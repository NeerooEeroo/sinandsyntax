&#65532;&#65532;Acknowledgments<br>
<br>
This book, more than most, reflects the energies not of one author but of many 
creative misbehavers. My thanks go first to all the writers whose words you'll 
see within these covers.<br>
<br>
In casting my net wide for examples of wicked and winning syntax, I was helped 
by many language scamps, including Martha Baer, Wallace Baine, Frank Clancy, 
Alex Frankel, Mark Frauenfelder, Jesse Freund, Sam Kane, Tim McGee, Keris 
Salmon, Brad Wieners, and Gary Wolf. Wallace Baine, especially, came through in 
spades.<br>
<br>
My researcher, Julie Greenberg, proved she could track down anything— even an 
almost forgotten 1969 Jell-O commercial. She also sent many useful surprises my 
way. Meri Brin was unbeatable on the Web and BBS beat. I have half a mind to 
stand in front of the San Francisco Main Library singing the praises of its 
reference desk— but the competition for a corner of Civic Center sidewalk is so 
fierce I'll keep my encomiums here. In particular, I thank Renée Tarshis and 
Peter Warhit, whose unbridled curiosity and unrelenting helpfulness are shared 
by their fellow librarians.<br>
<br>
Friends and colleagues read parts of the manuscript and saved me from most of my 
own excesses. Gifted wordsmiths all, Jessie Scanlon, Hollis Heimbouch, Emily 
McManus, Micki Esken-Meland, and Mary Beth Protomastro were especially generous 
with the juice. I'm not sure which is more dangerous— Jessie Scanlon's withering 
wit or her purple pen.<br>
<br>
Many thanks to my editor at Broadway Books, Suzanne Oaks, who has made me look 
good, and to Lisa Olney. The book also benefited greatly from the guidance of 
Matthew Martin and from the attentions of its copy editor, Rosalie Wieder, and 
its designer, Pei Loi Koay.<br>
<br>
I owe a special debt to Karen Elizabeth Gordon. She first sent me spinning in 
1984, when I bought her Transitive Vampire; in the past year she became mentor 
as well as muse, offering me an emergency writing table in the hills, Bariani 
olive oil, and a couple of killer line edits. Not to mention a foreword!<br>
<br>
Also in the special-debt department is my agent, Wendy Lipkind. This book would 
not have happened without her.<br>
<br>
My aunt and godmother, Eleanor Mayher Hackett, started giving me books of poetry 
before I could talk, and she read my manuscript with the kind of unconditional 
enthusiasm only an aunt can offer. I am lucky to have her.<br>
<br>
And finally, I must thank Bruce Lowell Bigelow, who knows all my sins.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;Foreword<br>
<br>
Oh, the sentence! The shuddering, sinuous, piquant, incandescent, delicate, 
delirious, sulking, strident possibilities of it all! A sentence can loll à 
l'odalisque, zap, implore, insist, soar, or simply lay out the facts. This 
handful of words, each with its own humble or brazen function, lies at the heart 
of every literary genre, every letter, memo, article, thesis, seduction, threat, 
and retort. In any book you handle, sentences abound. Here, in Sin and Syntax, 
they strut their stuff in all their guises and moods. From this exploration 
you'll emerge not only a more sharp-witted writer, but also a more attuned 
reader.<br>
<br>
Often when we speak, our ideas fly out half formed, in scattered confessions and 
pronouncements, in tattered repartee. It is in writing that we have the time and 
place to shape our sentences and see what we really think, taking ourselves as 
well as our readers by surprise or storm. We may not know what we're going to 
say (it's much more fun when we don't!), and the many ways of combining words 
help us discover meanings hidden in our own minds. The greater our grasp of 
these structures, the ampler our repertoire and experience in using them, the 
farther and deeper we can go.<br>
<br>
Books about writing not only abound— they are shamelessly on the make, taking up 
precious space in bookstores where literature and lovingly crafted nonfiction 
should be holding biblioshoppers in thrall. I have read few of these how-to and 
hold-your-hand-while-you-try manuals because it was literature that taught me 
how to write, and my cursory glances in this section found few compelling pages 
on which to alight and linger. But when I heard that my fellow bad girl of 
grammar and style was writing a book called Sin and Syntax, my nostrils flared, 
my pulse quickened, my bodice ripped open— I had to take a look. My own 
association with the word syntax postdates my vampirical handbook, and links the 
divine order of a sentence with scandalous, unfettered behavior. A Yugoslav 
psychiatrist friend in New York, newly acquainted with my grammatical persona 
and hearing of my gypsy knockabout life, captured the paradox in a linguistic 
metaphor: &quot;That's not very syntactical.&quot; Thus sin seemed a perfect bedfellow for 
syntax. Words sleep around, and the tongues of the world are enhanced in the 
process.<br>
<br>
At times I've envisioned language as a body with its own surge and rhythms and 
whims, other times as a diaphanous garment that both hides and reveals. But 
always I see grammar as the choreographer of our language, coordinating the 
movements of our baffling, flummoxed urge to express, to give voice to the 
ineffable. Familiarity with the rules of grammar tones our mental musculature, 
expands our repertoire, sets us free to dance. To break the rules consciously or 
go around them on purpose is a pleasure multiplied: willful violation, defiance, 
or deviation with a wicked glint in the eye. The sound, the taste, the thrill of 
language, its rhythms and edges and riffs— which impart another sort of 
precision— you will also find underscored in Sin and Syntax. To me, music is the 
message, and play, the muse and master of all creation, romps across this realm.<br>
<br>
Chapter by chapter, Constance Hale's book is about the rigors and romance of 
sentences, and sharpening one's senses in the reading and the making of them. It 
shows how a sentence comes together through the dance of words, how one sentence 
follows another in an effective piece of prose. Here you will see parts of 
speech in action, make tracks with parallel structure, catch a coquettish phrase 
at its arc, or curl up with a curvaceous clause. In dens of iniquity you will 
consort with the demons you once feared; you will dispel misgivings like bubbles 
of soap. You will return to this very passage and pronounce it overwrought. But 
flesh and the devil call for flamboyance now and then, and the legitimate haunts 
of fanfare include prefaces as well as ads. Here you will learn to handle the 
bones of writing, to articulate a skeleton before it's dressed and adorned and 
sets out to stir up its chosen mischief. A knowing body you will become.<br>

&#65532;&#65532;Introduction<br>
<br>
Driven by some combustible mix of passion (for the power and poetry of words) 
and desperation (so many snags in your sentences!), you've picked up a book 
called Sin and Syntax. What, you're wondering, does syntax— that collection of 
prissy grammar rules dictating how to put words together— have to do with sin— 
the reckless urge to flout the rules and abandon propriety altogether?<br>
<br>
Sin and Syntax plays with dynamic tensions in language: The underlying codes 
that give prose its clarities yet fail to explain its beauties. The sludge and 
sloth that muddle your writing. The delight in the wicked and the wacky. Sin and 
Syntax is about the skill that allows you, the writer, to harness such 
complexities, to create prose that thrills.<br>
<br>
Are you ready to turn syntax from a minefield into a stamping ground— your 
stamping ground? Forget schoolmarmish rules. Forget grammar as it was drilled 
and grilled in grade school. Rest assured, you'll get your grammar here, on the 
theory that it's better to know rules than to stay clueless. This book will show 
you how to avoid bonehead mistakes, but, more importantly, it'll show you how to 
make some sinful mischief.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
IF ALL THIS SEEMS a bit paradoxical, get used to it. Language is paradox.<br>
<br>
Sin and Syntax dwells in contradictions, dabbling in the eloquence of tradition, 
the intelligence of goofy grammars, the decadence of dialects. We'll root around 
where language is the most playful and plastic: in the pop, the vernacular, the 
mongrel tongues. We'll look at how the highbrow and the lowbrow define the 
exciting edges of prose and how the middlebrow dooms it to mediocrity. We'll 
diss commonplace lingos like legalese and computerese and ditch the lifeless 
codes of Standard Written English.<br>
<br>
We'll also summon the spirit of renegades who ignore taboos and make the 
language sing, from Shakespeare to Mark Twain to Chuck D. We'll wallow with Walt 
Whitman, who ridiculed the &quot;dictionary makers,&quot; insisting that language had its 
base &quot;broad and low, close to the ground.&quot; We'll look at English as a robust, 
swarthy tongue, capable of surviving tumult and thriving on innovation.<br>
<br>
T. S. Eliot once argued that a language with identical spoken and written forms 
would be &quot;practically intolerable,&quot; since no one would listen to the first or 
read the second. Eliot was cool, but don't be fooled by false dichotomies. 
Insisting on literary language, on strict structures and stuffy phrasing, means 
you may miss the shifting brilliances of the colloquial and the colorful. On the 
other hand, glorifying the spoken, demanding that people &quot;write as they speak,&quot; 
can put a higher premium on the pedestrian than on graceful grammar, stylistic 
complexity, and rich vocabulary. A passion for new terms and easy slang is 
great, but discretion, sensitivity, and masterful metaphor still matter.<br>
<br>
In figuring out how to write better, let's look to the ways the spoken and the 
written crisscross and connect and cross-pollinate. Let's look to texts like the 
Book of Common Prayer, which was written to be read out loud, and to 
speechmakers like Winston Churchill, who wrote and rewrote and practiced and 
repracticed before he ever preached. Let's look to the voices of cyberspace and 
to the rhythms of rap, celebrating the syntax and sounds that make narratives 
hop.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
BOOKS ON PROSE STYLE, of course, are as old as sin— or at least as old as 
Aristotle, who launched the industry with Poetics and Rhetoric. You'll see the 
names of Aristotle's descendants mentioned throughout the book: Hugh Blair, 
Henry Fowler, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, George Orwell, Sir Ernest Gowers. These 
men have refined the rules of writing over the centuries, their efforts 
culminating in the terse commandments of William Strunk and E. B. White (Use the 
active voice. Omit needless words. Avoid foreign languages). The most recent god 
of prose style, William Zinsser, further distilled the wisdom of the ancients 
into what he called, in his classic On Writing Well, &quot;four articles of faith&quot;: 
clarity, simplicity, brevity, and humanity.<br>
<br>
Sin and Syntax accepts the high bar set by Zinsser— and uses grammar and syntax 
to help you clear it. Sin and Syntax holds that the flesh of prose gets its 
shape and strength from the bones of grammar, and that sinfully good writing 
depends on understanding both the arcana of syntax and the artistry of music.<br>
<br>
Adding a little illicit activity to &quot;articles of faith,&quot; Sin and Syntax offers 
these new principles of prose:<br>
<br>
RELISH EVERY WORD.<br>
<br>
BE SIMPLE, BUT GO DEEP.<br>
<br>
TAKE RISKS.<br>
<br>
SEEK BEAUTY.<br>
<br>
FIND THE RIGHT PITCH.<br>
<br>
Moving from the most basic to the most sophisticated, Sin and Syntax covers the 
parts of speech and how to exploit them (in &quot;Words&quot;), shows the parts of a 
sentence and how to arrange them (in &quot;Sentences&quot;), and reveals how voice, 
lyricism, melody, and rhythm give prose its mystery and poetry (in &quot;Music&quot;).<br>
<br>
Within these three parts, &quot;Words,&quot; &quot;Sentences,&quot; and &quot;Music,&quot; the book's 
individual chapters are broken into four sections:<br>
<br>
• The Bones section is the grammar sermonette. It gives you simple keys to 
grammar, one at a time. Learn the sensible system, if only to know how to escape 
it in flights of creative fancy (it's more flexible than those English teachers 
would have you believe). We won't linger on every arcane point— you 
Marian-the-Librarian types who find your appetite whetted for more can consult 
Appendix 3 for a hefty list of grammar guides.<br>
<br>
• The Flesh section contains the lesson on writing. Linking grammar to prose, it 
shows how the parts of speech, the syntax of sentences, and the techniques of 
music give us the best stories. It also includes samples of prose by writers who 
exploit grammar in every graf.<br>
<br>
• Cardinal Sins catalogs true transgressions: errors made in ignorance. Exposing 
the disaster that lurks in mangled syntax, this section also debunks those 
horrid myths that often substitute for a real understanding of the underpinnings 
of language. (Don't split infinitives. Don't start a sentence with a 
conjunction. Don't end a sentence with a preposition.) Cardinal Sins sets you 
straight.<br>
<br>
• Carnal Pleasures shows how, sometimes, writing works because it hews 
exquisitely to the underlying codes of language. And how, sometimes, writing 
works because it defies the codes— or seems to. Carnal Pleasures contains 
playful, riotous, sometimes subversive pieces of writing, and shows how breaking 
the rules can lead to breakthrough prose.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Sin and Syntax is designed so that the novice can march from chapter to chapter 
in an orderly fashion, learning how to sync the parts, one at a time. But it is 
also designed so that the prose veteran can head directly to troublesome areas 
for a refresher course in grammar and a reliable list of do's and don'ts.<br>
<br>
Straightening out grammar and syntax is not the be-all and end-all of writing. 
But you need a command of language as much as you need a commanding idea. When 
style complements substance, when technique is put into the service of a good 
tale, prose can plunge deep and pulse with life.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;&#65532; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Part 1<br>
<br>
Words<br>
The French mime Etienne Decroux used to remind his students, &quot;One pearl is 
better than a whole necklace of potatoes.&quot; What is true for that wordless art 
form applies equally to writing: well-crafted prose depends on the writer's 
ability to discriminate between pearls and potatoes. Only some words are fit to 
be strung into sentences.<br>
<br>
Great writers are meticulous with their pearls, sifting through piles of words 
and stringing only perfect specimens upon the thread of syntax. The careful 
execution of beautiful, powerful prose through beautiful, powerful words is 
guided by these principles:<br>
<br>
RELISH EVERY WORD.<br>
<br>
True prose stylists carry on an impassioned, lifelong love affair with words, 
banishing bad words like so many banal suitors, burnishing the good ones till 
they shimmer. Be infatuated, be seduced, be obsessed.<br>
<br>
But be smart about words, too. &quot;All words are pegs to hang ideas on,&quot; wrote 
nineteenth-century essayist Henry Ward Beecher: words not linked to ideas are 
not worthy of writing— or reading. Once you've committed your words to paper (or 
to the screen), test each term. Does it carry your idea? Does it express, 
exactly, that once inchoate thought?<br>
<br>
Sensitize yourself to denotation and connotation. Denotation, the dictionary 
definition of a word, refers to its explicit or literal meanings. Connotation, 
the suggestive power of a word, refers to its implicit or latent meanings. The 
denotations of peach (a single-seeded fruit with tangy yellowish pulp and downy 
skin that goes from yellow to red) and mango (a single-seeded fruit with a tangy 
yellowish pulp and firm skin mottled with greens, yellows, and reds) differ only 
slightly. But where peach summons up hot summers in Georgia and the cheeks of a 
Southern belle, mango conjures images of India and Mexico— and the paintings of 
Gauguin. The two fruits may be interchangeable in cooking, but wouldn't it be a 
mistake to swap in mango when writing about, say, the dusty peach chambres of a 
grande dame with a thing for Louis XVI?<br>
<br>
Beyond the sense of a word is its sensuousness: its sound, its cadence, its 
spirit. In turning a phrase, let the words build like a jazz riff, allowing the 
meanings and melodies of one word to play off the meanings and melodies of the 
words around it.<br>
<br>
BE SIMPLE, BUT GO DEEP.<br>
<br>
The exquisite &quot;cutouts&quot; of Matisse and elegant line drawings of Picasso came 
late in long careers of painstaking work and wild experimentation. In writing as 
in painting, simplicity often follows considerable torment. &quot;People used to call 
me a good writer,&quot; mused John Ruskin, giant of the nineteenth-century essay. 
&quot;Now they say I can't write at all; because, for instance, if I think anybody's 
house is on fire, I only say, 'Sir, your house is on fire.'… I used to say, 
'Sir, the abode in which you probably passed the delightful days of youth is in 
a state of inflammation.'&nbsp;&quot;<br>
<br>
Verbose is not a synonym for literary. A member of the British Parliament once 
commented that if a bureaucrat had tried to express Lord Nelson's &quot;England 
expects every man to do his duty,&quot; posterity would have been left with England 
anticipates that as regards the current emergency personnel will face up to the 
issues and exercise appropriately the functions allocated to their respective 
occupation groups. Bureaucrats and business writers too often prefer big words 
when they're naming little things. Let's not forsake short, common words that 
name big things— hope and pride, for example— or simple couplings that leave 
concrete impressions, like the red wheelbarrow. Shakespeare's &quot;sleep that knits 
up the ravell'd sleeve of care&quot; uses simple words to go deep. No big-shot words, 
but a big idea.<br>
<br>
It's not enough, though, to be just simple. &quot;Nine pounds where three are 
sufficient is obesity,&quot; said Frank Lloyd Wright. &quot;But to eliminate expressive 
words in speaking or writing— words that intensify or vivify meaning— is not 
simplicity. It may be, or usually is, stupidity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Henry David Thoreau pored over Walden, revising it again and again to find words 
that &quot;intensify or vivify meaning.&quot; This journal entry left him unsatisfied:<br>
<br>
I have travelled some in New England, especially in Concord, and I found that no 
enterprise was on foot which it would not disgrace a man to take part in. They 
seemed to be employed everywhere in shops and offices and fields. They seemed, 
like the Brahmins of the East, to be doing penance in a thousand, curious, 
unheard-of ways.<br>
<br>
Setting upon those sentences, clearing the unnecessary words and repetitions, 
Thoreau crafted a single sentence with greater power:<br>
<br>
I have travelled a good deal in Concord, and everywhere, in shops and offices 
and fields, the inhabitants have seemed to me to be doing penance in a thousand 
curious ways.<br>
<br>
Thoreau manages to make his idea more specific by panning right in on Concord, 
paring down his repetitions (they, initially repeated twice, is swept away by 
the stronger inhabitants), and cutting more quickly to the final, stirring 
phrase.<br>
<br>
TAKE RISKS.<br>
<br>
After having suffered the hyperactive red pens of schoolmarms and the 
hypercorrect rules of inflexible pedagogues, too many of us have retreated to 
the realm of the safe, the standard, and the vague. A &quot;mixture of vagueness and 
sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose,&quot; 
wrote George Orwell in &quot;Politics and the English Language.&quot; &quot;As soon as certain 
topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to 
think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of 
words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked 
together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hidden in such prefab prose is a fear of going to the edge. But it's romping 
around on the fringes of language that gives writing its frisson. The right word 
might be snagged off the street, snatched from another language, or hatched in 
the sand tray of the imagination. Dive into the polyglot English tongue, taking 
a cue from Walt Whitman, that high priest of the rambunctious:<br>
<br>
I like limber, lasting, fierce words. I like them applied to myself— and I like 
them in newspapers, courts, debates, Congress. Do you suppose the liberties and 
the brawn of These States have to do only with delicate lady-words? with gloved 
gentleman words? Bad presidents, bad judges, bad clients, bad editors, owners of 
slaves, and the long ranks of Northern political suckers (robbers, traitors, 
suborned), monopolists, infidels,… shaved persons, supplejacks, ecclesiastics, 
men not fond of women, women not fond of men, cry down the use of strong, 
cutting, beautiful rude words. [But] to the manly instincts of the People they 
will be forever welcome.<br>
<br>
Whitman's American English scarfs up words from other languages with a 
vengeance. If someone's bugging you, you can go the Anglo-Saxon route and shun 
her; or you can avoid her (Latin); or you can eschew her (French). Or you can 
tell her to get outta your face. Don't shun slang, especially when it's vivid 
and musical and fills a gap in the lexicon. Think of the words Shakespeare 
invented: the adjectives long-haired, lackluster, unqualitied, green-eyed, 
heartsick, and hot-blooded, the nouns want-wit, vinegar aspect, and wit-snapper, 
and the verbs in lines like &quot;You unlace your reputation thus&quot; or &quot;The tears that 
spanieled me at heels.&quot; More modern neologists have kept up the mischief, giving 
us gems like snafu, snarky, muckety-mucks, chump change, copasetic, airhead, 
hacker, and, oh, babelicious.<br>
<br>
A word not in the dictionary is not out of bounds. Isn't the newly popular noun 
bloviator perfect to describe that dude who can't get enough of his own voice? 
H. L. Mencken carried on about coinages bubbling up out of the American 
experience; one of his favorites, rubberneck, he called &quot;almost a complete 
treatise on American psychology… [conveying the] boldness and contempt for 
ordered forms that are so characteristically American… the grotesque humor of 
the country, the delight in devastating opprobriums, and the acute feeling for 
the succinct and savory.&quot;<br>
<br>
You tell 'em, H. L.!<br>
<br>
SEEK BEAUTY.<br>
<br>
Brevity isn't everything. Winston Churchill, who generally endorsed short and 
simple words, chose flocculent over woolly in describing the mental process of 
certain people in his treatise The Second World War. Why? Flocculent carries an 
edge of contempt, echoing words like flop, flap, flaccid, flimsy, and flabby. 
Winston knew that sounds can make words sing.<br>
<br>
In our media-driven age, when the succinct sound bite and the skeletal headline 
push us to ever more elliptical expression, we need to make space for meaning. 
The constrictive columns on the newspaper's front page make probe a popular 
synonym for investigation, inquiry, or hearing, but check out the unintended 
ambiguities of this abominable headline: &quot;City's Housing Chief Probed.&quot; (Did he 
say &quot;Ouch&quot;?) Journalist G. K. Chesterton once quipped that when it comes to such 
headlines, brevity, &quot;so far from being the soul of wit, is even the death of 
meaning.&quot; Don't cede to the city editor who insists on cure &quot;because no one 
knows the meaning of palliative.&quot; The reporter writing a humorous story on 
commemorative parties as a palliative for &quot;the earthquake willies&quot; should 
adamantly refuse to swap in cure— because there is none for the fear of 
earthquakes!<br>
<br>
Tight deadlines, TV tastes, small screens, easy shortcuts— we should never let 
any of these cramp our meandering search for the beautiful, rich word. For 
inspiration, go on literary adventures with novelists like William Faulkner, 
Djuna Barnes, Vladimir Nabokov, and Gabriel García Márquez— none of whom uses 
lowest-common-denominator diction. Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! delivers 
non-monosyllabic monologues like this one, by Mississippi spinster Rosa 
Coldfield. The sixty-five-year-old &quot;widowed virgin&quot; reflects bitterly about her 
latent &quot;root bloom and urge,&quot; which was driven underground when, at fourteen, 
she fell in love only to be badly jilted. Faulkner's rich words have all the 
pungency of emotions that have been on low simmer for half a century:<br>
<br>
Once there was (they cannot have told you this) a summer of wistaria. It was a 
pervading everywhere of wistaria (I was fourteen then) as though of all springs 
yet to capitulate condensed into one spring, one summer: the spring and 
summertime which is every female's who breathed above dust, beholden of all 
betrayed springs held over from all irrevocable time, repercussed, bloomed 
again. It was a vintage year of wistaria: vintage year being that sweet 
conjunction of root bloom and urge and hour and weather; and I (I was fourteen)— 
I will not insist on bloom, at whom no man had yet to look— nor would ever— 
twice, as not as child but less than any female flesh. Nor do I say leaf— warped 
bitter pale and crimped half-fledgling intimidate of any claim to green which 
might have drawn to it the tender mayfly childhood sweetheart games or given 
pause to the male predacious wasps and bees of later lust. But root and urge I 
do insist and claim, for had I not heired too from all the unsistered Eves since 
the Snake? Yes, urge I do: warped chrysalis of what blind perfect seed: for who 
shall say what gnarled forgotten root might not bloom yet with some globed 
concentrate more globed and concentrate and heady-perfect because the neglected 
root was planted warped and lay not dead but merely slept forgot?<br>
<br>
FIND THE RIGHT PITCH.<br>
<br>
Prose is a human exchange between writer and reader. Everything consigned to the 
page needs to ring true. Keep your audience in mind, especially when you are 
setting style and tone; don't talk to readers as if they are strangers, or as if 
they are beneath you.<br>
<br>
The creator of Sancho Panza showed perfect pitch with &quot;How excellent a thing is 
sleep; it wraps a man round like a cloak&quot;; the pitch would be ruined by a writer 
fond of pompous words: &quot;among the beneficent qualities of sleep its capacity for 
withdrawing the human consciousness from the contemplation of immediate 
circumstances may perhaps be accounted not the least remarkable.&quot; (That parody 
of Panza was penned by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch.)<br>
<br>
Many lawyers perpetuate such pretentious diction and alienate their readers, not 
to mention their clients. No attorney goes home and says at the dinner table, 
&quot;Please pass the green beans. Said green beans are excellent.&quot; Pompous phrasing 
often serves no purpose other than to puff up the speaker.<br>
<br>
Jargon— the technical words and code phrases that professionals use with one 
another— can keep a lay reader in the dark. When one computer programmer tells 
another to &quot;type 'hash bang slash user slash local slash bin slash perl'&nbsp;&quot; 
(i.e., &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;) that coders' jargon is serving its proper 
purpose, helping two people work efficiently. But when marketing mavens promote 
hardware and software to the public, their words are softer than software: 
implementation, functionality, interoperability, and even ease of use are just a 
bunch of junk words. Jargon can reflect institutions and industries more than it 
does the real humans who banter within them. Let the CEOs sit behind their desks 
and yammer on about brand identification, market capitalization, and shareholder 
value. If you want to write eloquently as a professional, you need to do it with 
good words. Universal words.<br>
<br>
To find the right pitch is to be human, to have a sense of the street, while 
still reaching for the lofty. It means resisting the kind of language that suits 
cogs in a machine better than sentient beings. George Orwell concocted this 
impenetrable sentence to show what happens when we lose an ear for our own 
voices:<br>
<br>
Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that 
success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be 
commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the 
unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.<br>
<br>
Orwell's sentence, with its inflated abstractions, makes a mess of a statement 
that started out as the epitome of simplicity, clarity, and humanity. The 
sentence comes from Ecclesiastes, and shows how well the seventeenth-century 
scholars who translated the Bible into English understood the notion of pitch:<br>
<br>
I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the 
battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of 
understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to 
them all.<br>
<br>
Every word in that sentence is a pearl, and every word helps set a pitch that is 
at once humble and universal.<br>

Nouns<br>

<br>
What would a grammar book be if it didn't lounge around in a little Latin? Let's 
take the word noun, which derives from nomen, for &quot;name.&quot; This is useful Latin 
trivia (granted, a rare thing), since it tells us exactly why nouns exist: to 
name people, places, and things. &quot;Things&quot; can be tangible (objects that you can 
see or smell or hold or hear) or intangible (feelings, ideas, and abstract 
concepts).<br>
<br>
In Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number, Jacobo Timerman creates an 
indelible image of the cell in which he was imprisoned for criticizing the 
official cruelty of Argentina's military.<br>
<br>
Timerman's nouns are unadorned, naked, stripped of attention-grabbing 
adjectives, as hard as the cell itself. In fact, his description is powered by 
nouns, and he draws amply from each of the four noun classes:<br>
<br>
• People: guard, guards<br>
<br>
• Places: cell, corridor, house<br>
<br>
• Concrete things: door, arms, body, knees, ceiling, walls, names, messages, 
floor, mattress, blanket, shoulders, crack, air, watch, cigarette, wife's 
lighter, gold Rolex watches, Dupont cigarette lighters, Argentine security 
forces<br>
<br>
• Intangible things: luck, encouragement, vestige, testimony, time, 
semi-penumbra, semi-air, temptation, obsession, sensation, freedom, entire 
universe, Time, time, Time, existence, duration, eternity<br>
<br>
The cell is narrow. When I stand at its center, facing the steel door, I can't 
extend my arms. But it is long, and when I lie down, I can stretch out my entire 
body. A stroke of luck, for in the cell I previously occupied— for how long?— I 
was forced to huddle up when seated and keep my knees bent while lying down.<br>
<br>
The cell is quite high. When I jump, I'm unable to touch the ceiling. The white 
walls have been recently painted. Undoubtedly they once had names on them, 
messages, words of encouragement, dates. They are now bereft of any vestige or 
testimony.<br>
<br>
The floor of the cell is permanently wet. Somewhere there's a leak. The mattress 
is also wet. I have a blanket, and to prevent that from getting wet I keep it on 
my shoulders constantly. If I lie down with the blanket on top of me, the part 
of my body touching the mattress gets soaked. I discover it's best to roll up 
the mattress so that one part of it doesn't touch the ground. In time, the top 
part dries. This means, though, that I can't lie down, but must sleep seated. My 
life goes on during this period— for how long?— either standing or seated.<br>
<br>
The cell has a steel door with an opening that allows part of a face, a minimal 
part, to be visible. The guard has orders to keep the opening shut. Light enters 
from the outside through a small crack, which acts also as an air vent. This is 
the only ventilation and light. A faint glow, night and day, eliminating time. 
Producing a semi-penumbra within an atmosphere of contaminated air, semi-air….<br>
<br>
One of the guards has my watch. During an interrogation another guard offered me 
a cigarette and lit it with my wife's lighter. I later learned that they were 
under army orders not to steal anything from my house throughout the kidnapping 
but succumbed to temptation. Gold Rolex watches and Dupont cigarette lighters 
were almost an obsession with the Argentine security forces during that year of 
1977.<br>
<br>
Tonight, a guard, not following the rules, leaves the peephole ajar. I wait a 
while to see what will happen but it remains open. Standing on tiptoe, I peer 
out. There's a narrow corridor, and across from my cell I can see at least two 
other doors. Indeed, I have a full view of two doors. What a sensation of 
freedom! An entire universe added to my Time, that elongated time which hovers 
over me oppressively in the cell. Time, that dangerous enemy of man, when its 
existence, duration, and eternity are virtually palpable.<br>
<br>
Choosing common, generic words, Timerman uses their dreariness to his advantage: 
the scene is painted plainly through the cell, the floor, the mattress, a 
blanket, as is the narrator, with his arms, body, knees, shoulders. The few 
proper nouns Timerman adds— Rolex watches, Dupont cigarette lighters, Argentine 
security forces— give the piece an eerie specificity, though not enough to 
detract from the sense that the main character is less Jacobo Timerman than 
Everyman.<br>
<br>
In a piece so sparely written, the intangible nouns stand out: words like 
semi-penumbra, contaminated air, and semi-air convey Timerman's grim 
predicament, while others, like life, light, glow, sensation, freedom, an entire 
universe, Time, existence, duration, eternity, attest to his hopes. Such 
intangible nouns, when used so expertly, convey an author's themes and offer 
glimpses into the human condition.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Every noun is either a person, place, concrete thing, or intangible thing.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
As Timerman's passage shows, plain nouns can also be strong: they can convey 
vivid images and powerful emotions. Not all nouns need be plain, but they must 
all be strong. So what's the difference between a strong noun and a weak one? 
Style coaches like the Fowler brothers and Strunk and White have defined strong 
nouns in mantras that go something like this:<br>
<br>
Prefer the familiar word to the highfalutin.<br>
<br>
Prefer the single word to the circumlocution.<br>
<br>
Prefer the short word to the long.<br>
<br>
Prefer the standard to the offbeat.<br>
<br>
Prefer the specific to the general.<br>
<br>
Prefer the definite to the vague.<br>
<br>
Prefer the concrete to the abstract.<br>
<br>
Most of this makes sense. Who wouldn't take a kiss, any day, over a 
&quot;demonstration of affection&quot;? You keep your &quot;domestic partner&quot;; I'll clutch my 
lover, my sweetie, my one-and-only. Let's skip town in a little red Corvette, 
forgetting forever the dreariness of &quot;an automobile&quot; or— heaven forbid— &quot;a 
sport-utility vehicle.&quot;<br>
<br>
But in the fever for the fast and familiar, the prose pedagogues can go too far. 
They canonize &quot;the standard,&quot; forgetting that slang and regionalisms are 
colorful, full of verve, and adopted with alacrity. H. L. Mencken championed New 
World neologisms like cloudburst (&quot;Why describe a gigantic rainstorm with the 
lame adjectives of every day?&quot;) and roughneck (&quot;more… savory than any English 
equivalent&quot;).<br>
<br>
&quot;House&quot; is familiar, it's short, and it's standard, but why ignore the options, 
which include cottage, duplex, dacha, shack, bungalow, A-frame, Tudor, 
Victorian, hacienda, manor, and wickiup? (Don't even think about colorless words 
like abode, dwelling, domicile, or residence.) Create analogies: is that pile of 
wood and steel a poor man's Fallingwater? a Tony-Smith-on-stilts? or a Bauhaus 
mineshaft?<br>
<br>
Choosing the right noun means exploring the layers of a word. First, it must be 
precise, conveying the exact image you are rendering: pick bungalow if you're 
describing a one-story house with a low pitched roof. Second, your noun must be 
rich, its connotations conjuring a realm of emotion or sensation: stay with 
bungalow if you're capturing coziness, a homey atmosphere. Finally, your noun 
must be apt— its associations, its links to other words and ideas, must 
complement your meaning: Are the occupants a bunch of frat boys? Then crash pad 
might work better.<br>
<br>
Nouns can be playful. When Ferdinand LeMenthe (leader of the Red Hot Peppers) 
was upstaged by a comedian calling himself &quot;Sweet Papa Cream Puff right out of 
the bakery shop,&quot; the early jazzman rechristened himself &quot;Sweet Papa Jelly Roll, 
with stovepipes in my hips and all the women in town dyin' to turn my damper 
down.&quot; According to an account by J. L. Dillard in American English, LeMenthe 
was rolling together myriad associations: jeli in the African Mandingo language 
is a minstrel popular with women because of his skill with words and music; in 
the Caribbean, jelly refers to the meat of the coconut when it is still white 
and viscous, resembling semen; in Harlem, street associations for the gooey 
pastry have included lover, vagina, and sex itself.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Over the centuries, grammar guides and style manuals have favored Anglo-Saxon 
pedigree.<br>
<br>

<br>
WITH HIS NEW NAME, Jelly Roll Morton was branding himself for his avid fans. 
Brand names, when they work, are killer nouns— pithy and packed with meaning. 
Memorable brands are nouns so evocative that they become synonymous with the 
thing they name, whether a soft drink (Coca-Cola), a laundry detergent (Tide), 
or a train line (the Orient Express). Sometimes brands are jeux de mots. In 
1989, starting with the terms laptop and notebook, Apple serendipitously hit 
upon PowerBook, combining the notion of a small product brimming with 
information and the image of pure computing muscle. Likewise, in 1982, a Texas 
Instruments spinoff searching for a name combined comp (shorthand for computer) 
with pack (small, integral object). Changing the ck to a q made the name stand 
out in the gray text of the Wall Street Journal, and Compaq packed a nice double 
entendre.<br>
<br>
The automobile industry knows big brands and big busts. The best names combine 
meaning, message, and melody: Acura (conveying precise engineering), Alliance (a 
joint effort by France's Renault and American Motors), and Caravan (&quot;It's a car! 
It's a van! No, it's a parade!&quot;). Less successful names try for euphony and end 
up just phony: Celica, Sentra, Camry, Tercel. Some names are conceived as bursts 
of testosterone, then bloom into doomed alphabet soups: ES, GXE, STEAWD, TSi. 
(OK, OK, an early one, the Datsun 280Z, showed some imagination— a sporty Datsun 
as dashing as Zorro— but it's been downhill from there.) Then come the boners— 
betraying an absolute ignorance of the English language: Would you have wanted a 
Dictator to take you for a ride? (Studebaker, ca. 1927.) Wonder why Ford's 
Nucleon, er, bombed?<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
SOMETIMES NOUNS PINWHEEL around a subject, giving it a multicolored vitality. An 
SF Weekly profile of Rosalie Sorrels began by calling the folksinger &quot;part poet, 
part parent, part pioneer, part provocateur.&quot; Francis X. Clines, in the New York 
Times, referred to Judge Kenneth Starr's style as &quot;part Garbo, part Inspector 
Javert.&quot;<br>
<br>
Descriptions of people, places, or things require powerhouse nouns. Good 
character sketches focus right in on concrete details, as does this profile of 
Dizzy Gillespie from the New Yorker. The writer, Whitney Balliett, starts with 
Gillespie's duds, focusing next on the jewelry, the cheeks, the mouth, and, 
finally, the eyes:<br>
<br>
Gillespie, who is not a clotheshorse, was wearing a Sherlock Holmes hat, and 
houndstooth jacket, rumpled striped brown pants, a navy-blue T-shirt, and a 
couple of medallions suspended from a long gold neck chain. He hasn't changed 
much in the last ten years. He has a medium-length grayish Afro, and he looks 
grizzly. His huge and celebrated cheeks are broadsides in repose and spinnakers 
in action, and he has a scimitar smile and a thousand tiny, even teeth. He likes 
to smile and roll his eyes in mock surprise, but most of the time his eyes are 
narrowed; they take in much and send out little, and when he puts on his 
dark-rimmed, two-ton glasses they disappear.<br>
<br>
Balliett's precise images give us a clear snapshot of Gillespie, and the 
perfectly pitched metaphors (cheeks that are &quot;broadsides in repose and 
spinnakers in action&quot;) make the portrait breathe.<br>
<br>
Andy Warhol, predictably, took a different tack when describing himself in The 
Philosophy of Andy Warhol. He started with intangible nouns (modified by some 
hefty adjectives) before settling on the hair, the skin, the scars, the cords of 
the neck, and the Adam's apple:<br>
<br>
The bored languor, the wasted pallor…. The chic freakiness, the basically 
passive astonishment…. The chintzy joy, the revelatory tropisms, the chalky, 
puckish mask, the slightly Slavic look…. The childlike, gum-chewing naïveté, the 
glamour rooted in despair, the self-admiring carelessness, the perfected 
otherness, the wispiness, the shadowy, voyeuristic, vaguely sinister aura…. The 
albino-chalk skin. The knobby knees. The roadmap of scars. The long bony arms, 
so white they look bleached…. The graying lips. The shaggy, silver-white hair, 
soft and metallic. The cords of the neck standing out around the big Adam's 
apple. It's all there.<br>
<br>
In crafting descriptions of people and things, many writers make the mistake of 
loading up adjectives. But the best concentrate on noun-filled detail. In 
Burning the Days, James Salter goes far beyond the merely generic &quot;West Point 
cadet's uniform,&quot; offering his reader specific, concrete nouns that add up to an 
anthropology of military culture:<br>
<br>
For parade and inspections we wore eighteenth-century accessories, crossed white 
belts and dummy cartridge box, with breastplate and belt buckle shined to a 
mirrorlike finish. In the doorway of the room at night, before taps, we sat 
feverishly polishing them. Pencil erasers and jeweler's rouge were used to 
painstakingly rub away small imperfections, and the rest was done with a 
constantly refolded polishing cloth. It took hours. The terrible ring of metal 
on the floor— a breastplate that had slipped from someone's hand— was like the 
dropping of an heirloom.<br>
<br>
Salter gives us not just the glimmering &quot;breastplate and belt buckle,&quot; but the 
&quot;pencil erasers&quot; and &quot;jeweler's rouge&quot; that burnish them. And in one noun— 
&quot;heirloom&quot;— he conveys an entire, centuries-old legacy.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
Nouns were big in Gregory the Great's Moralia, which first warned us of the 
dangers of Pride, Envy, Anger, Lust, Gluttony, Covetousness, and Sloth. Lurking 
in more contemporary texts are the Seven Deadly Sins committed with nouns: 
Sloth, Gluttony, Fog, Pretense, Gobbledygook, Jargon, and Euphemism.<br>
<br>
SLOTH.<br>
<br>
If you can't be bothered to pick up a thesaurus, you are not a prose stylist. 
You are a hack. Sloth means grabbing the closest shopworn words without so much 
as a glimmer of guilt, or hastily creating inelegant nouns out of other nouns, 
or even verbs. Watch out for the slapping together of prefixes on prefixes, 
suffixes on suffixes— don't create more clunkers like disintermediation, 
decentralization, effectualization, finalization, scrutinization, and that 
horrid replacement for &quot;use,&quot; utilization. William Safire once facetiously 
hailed the &quot;ugly but necessary new noun&quot; izationization, which he defined as 
&quot;the creation of lengthy nouns out of shorter words by adding -ization.&quot; Stop 
the suffix cut-and-paste acts; go on thoughtful searches for the right words.<br>
<br>
Clichés— trite phrases blanched of all meaning by overuse— also signal sloth. 
They may start life as vivid metaphors (whoever uttered &quot;It's raining cats and 
dogs&quot; for the first time found a catchy way to convey anarchy in the sky), but 
over time, clichés become drained of surprise and power, and writers rely on 
them only because they're handy and require no thought. Of course, many clichés 
never even had metaphorical merit to begin with. Avoid them all:<br>
<br>
level playing field<br>
<br>
new challenges<br>
<br>
(at) a crossroads<br>
<br>
bottom line<br>
<br>
fast track<br>
<br>
rat race<br>
<br>
old hat<br>
<br>
firm foundation<br>
<br>
Even students of prose can't always see the clichés for the trees. The Graduate 
School of Journalism at UC Berkeley once had to warn aspiring journalists 
against using &quot;honing my skills&quot; in their application essays; the phrase was 
turning up too much for the admissions office to bear.<br>
<br>
GLUTTONY.<br>
<br>
A close second to Sloth, Gluttony refers to the gourmandish urge to use five 
words where one would do. The gluttons yammer on about &quot;adverse climatic 
conditions&quot; instead of calling bad weather just that; rain is rain, and not 
&quot;precipitation activity&quot; or &quot;a thunderstorm probability situation.&quot; When Thomas 
Hardy wrote &quot;This is the weather the shepherd shuns/And so do I,&quot; he wisely did 
not say, &quot;The present weather conditions are causing considerable inconvenience 
to the sheepfarmer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Abstractions ending in -ion, like &quot;situation&quot; or &quot;condition,&quot; are setups. Don't 
be tempted to prettify a blunt noun like &quot;a drunk&quot; with a staggering noun phrase 
like &quot;a person in an intoxicated condition.&quot; Other words bloated with empty 
calories include case, character, degree, element, instance, kind, nature, and 
persuasion. These will lead you to roundabout prepositional phrases instead of 
straight nouns and verbs:<br>
<br>
&quot;His complaints are of a very far-reaching character.&quot; &#65532; His complaints ranged 
from leaky faucets to noises in his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Voters showed a greater degree of interest in the electoral process this year.&quot; 
&#65532; Citizens voted in droves.<br>
<br>
&quot;The wages will be low owing to the unremunerative nature of the work.&quot; &#65532; You're 
a teacher? Don't expect to get rich.<br>
<br>
&quot;People of the artistic persuasion require a degree of freedom.&quot; &#65532; Artists need 
freedom.<br>
<br>
FOG.<br>
<br>
Foggy thinking leads to vague and woolly words rather than concrete ones. 
Sometimes, a writer who hasn't stopped to think about what he or she is trying 
to say piles up abstract nouns like phenomenon, element, individual, objective. 
&quot;The phenomenon of a health anxiety&quot; should be defogged to, simply, &quot;anxiety 
about health.&quot; Some folks seem to be in the business of manufacturing fog: 
GreenTree Nutrition, Inc. called its Web site hawking health news, diet tips, 
and vitamins &quot;a business model focused on content-enabled commerce&quot;; a press 
release the company put out bragged about the &quot;deep Internet and nutraceutical 
industry knowledge&quot; of its investors and called its site the &quot;wellness hub 
people will come to for its deep, consumer-focused content and brand-agnostic 
wellness product superstore.&quot; That sentence could send even the healthy running 
for aspirin.<br>
<br>
Government writing suffers the worst smog levels. Until recently, an 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration &quot;egress&quot; standard read:<br>
<br>
Ways of exit access and the doors to exits to which they lead shall be so 
designed and arranged as to be clearly recognizable as such.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, OSHA rewrote the rule, coming up with:<br>
<br>
An exit must be free of signs or decorations that obscure its visibility.<br>
<br>
But what's wrong with this:<br>
<br>
Make sure exits are clearly marked and unobstructed.<br>
<br>
PRETENSE.<br>
<br>
Is it powermongering? Is it insecurity? Is it arrogance? Why do so many 
professors and professionals resort to pompous, ponderous, or just imponderable 
nouns?<br>
<br>
The worst offenders must be academics— and they're the ones teaching students 
how to write! Can you decipher this beaut from Eric Voegelin's The New Science 
of Politics:<br>
<br>
The problems of an eidos in history, hence, arises only when Christian 
transcendental fulfillment becomes immanentized. Such an immanentist hypostasis 
of the eschaton, however, is a theoretical fallacy.<br>
<br>
Did you catch the subject-verb disagreement there? (Problems… arises?) Even 
Voegelin lost track of his point!<br>
<br>
If the Ivory Tower and the Tower of Babel are converging, it's bad news for us 
all. Academic writing is on the creep. Check out these program notes from an 
opera production at Kansas State University:<br>
<br>
A perpetual dualism underlies the production style of this Susannah. In the 
first place, the mise-en-scène is not an environment in the naturalistic sense, 
but a conceptually-defined space intended as a spatial correlative to the 
elemental action of the opera. Indications of &quot;real&quot; time and place in scenery 
and costumes point away from abstractionism, rather than toward realism. By the 
same token, characters are pinned down to a specific historical period, yet 
their essential Gestus is timeless and universal.<br>
<br>
Don't those nouns— &quot;mise-en-scène,&quot; &quot;spatial correlative,&quot; &quot;elemental action,&quot; 
&quot;abstractionism,&quot; &quot;realism,&quot; &quot;Gestus&quot;— make you yearn for some trash TV?<br>
<br>
Professionals, unfortunately, have co-opted the professors' tricks (or tics). Go 
no further than the nearest business memo to find these hollow organization men: 
your consideration of this matter, your earliest convenience, the aforementioned 
point, and the corporate secretary's favorite, the above-referenced matter.<br>
<br>
Pretense results when a writer preoccupied with his or her own diction loses 
sight of the primary goal: communicating with an audience. Choose words that are 
appropriate for the subject, the audience, and the forum. When a father talking 
to his child's teacher mentions a &quot;colloquy&quot; with his seven-year-old daughter, 
he is not being articulate, he's being ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Whenever you've got a choice, go with the plain talk, not the pomposity.<br>
<br>
GOBBLEDYGOOK.<br>
<br>
Will we ever forgive Warren G. Harding for taking the perfectly good noun 
normality and perverting it into normalcy? Bureaucratese, of course, didn't end 
with Harding. Al Gore could be called Mr. Gobbledygook: online citizens, thank 
God, replaced his &quot;national information infrastructure&quot; with the Net. But Gore 
needed some netizens around at the 1997 press conference where he argued that 
&quot;no controlling legal authority&quot; deemed his 1996 campaign solicitations illegal. 
Why didn't Al just say, &quot;I didn't break the law&quot;?<br>
<br>
In gobbledygook, a year is &quot;twelve calendar months,&quot; orders are &quot;directives,&quot; 
down payments are &quot;capitalized cost reductions,&quot; and a weapons wonk is &quot;a 
specialist in arms control and security issues.&quot; A New York State fire officer 
who wrote this monthly progress report clearly wasn't in a rush to put out any 
flames:<br>
<br>
FIRE REPORT: Heavy rains throughout most of the State have given an optimistic 
outlook for lessened fire danger for the rest of the season. However, an 
abundance of lightning maintains a certain amount of hazard in isolated areas 
that have not received an excessive amount of rain. We were pleased to have been 
able to help Nevada with the suppression of their conflagration.<br>
<br>
That paragraph was quoted in the Bureau of Land Management's Gobbledygook Has 
Gotta Go. Look how easy it is to edit it down to plain talk and add a few strong 
nouns and verbs:<br>
<br>
FIRE REPORT: Heavy rains throughout most of the State have given an optimistic 
outlook for lessened fire danger for the rest of the season. However, an 
abundance of lightning maintains a certain amount of hazard in threatens 
isolated dry areas that have not received an excessive amount of rain. We were 
pleased to help have been able to Nevada fight fires. with the suppression of 
their conflagration.<br>
<br>
Public officials have periodically launched campaigns to eradicate gobbledygook 
from governmental communications. Jimmy Carter called for &quot;keeping it simple&quot; in 
1978, and Bill Clinton signed a similar executive order twenty years later. 
Things got so bad at the Justice Department in the early '90s that Attorney 
General Janet Reno urged the nation's lawyers to find &quot;small, old words that all 
people understand— words like 'right' and 'wrong' and 'justice.'&nbsp;&quot;<br>
<br>
JARGON.<br>
<br>
Reno may be fighting an uphill battle in taming the Justice Department, but 
she'd need to clone herself five times over to police the language in the 
national bar association. Like other professionals, lawyers rely on jargon— 
agreed-upon argot and technical lingo. A staple of every work conversation, 
jargon makes for a telegraphic shorthand that lets professionals banter 
precisely and efficiently. Lawyers' terms like plaintiff, ex parte, hearsay, 
felony, prima facie, and habeus corpus are, indeed, precise. But what about all 
those aforesaids, hereofs, and hereinbelows? That's not just jargon. It's junk. 
Legalese. Is it really necessary to say &quot;Now comes the above named John Doe, 
plaintiff herein, by and through Smith &amp; Jones, his attorneys of record, and 
shows unto this Honorable Court as follows…&quot;? Why not just &quot;For his complaint, 
the plaintiff says…&quot;? Why write &quot;I have received your letter and thank you for 
the information contained therein,&quot; when &quot;Thank you for the information relayed 
by your letter&quot; does the job?<br>
<br>
A parody in a lawyers' magazine once launched the story of &quot;Jack and the Bean 
Stalk&quot; like this: &quot;Once on or about a time, there was a minor named John or 
'Jack' (as he will hereinafter be designated), other name or names to your 
relator unknown.&quot;<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
WHEN IT COMES TO IMPENETRABILITY, legal writing is only the most notorious. 
Doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs— they've all got their own jargon and they 
all should avoid it when trying to communicate with clients or write for the lay 
public. As Steve Mirsky points out in Scientific American, the doctor mumbling 
about &quot;a bilateral digital amputation&quot; should just say a patient &quot;lost two 
fingers.&quot; Computer keyboards might lead to &quot;a diminution of digital dexterity, 
the end product of same being a severe limitation of your preoperative ability,&quot; 
but the doctor needs to tell the patient, &quot;rest your hands till they heal.&quot; The 
best docs know that a gift for the vernacular helps them communicate well with 
patients and write memorably about their field. The term &quot;tennis elbow&quot; beats 
&quot;lateral epicondylitis.&quot; &quot;Chauffeur's fracture&quot; sticks better than &quot;a break to 
the radial styloid&quot;— even if it means explaining that the name for this wrist 
injury pays homage to those drivers of old who hurt themselves turning a hand 
crank to rev up the Studebaker.<br>
<br>
EUPHEMISM.<br>
<br>
Let's concede that discretion is the better part of valor, and that civility, 
diplomacy, and tact are worth cultivating. We all have experienced the 
compassionate desire to address something unbearably painful or embarrassing— 
the death of a beloved, say, or a distressing medical condition— without causing 
someone else even more pain and embarrassment.<br>
<br>
But such a concession is not an endorsement of euphemism— the description of 
offensive behavior through inoffensive terms. &quot;Political language is designed to 
make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of 
solidity to pure wind,&quot; wrote George Orwell in &quot;Politics and the English 
Language.&quot; &quot;In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of 
the indefensible…. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the 
inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine gunned, the huts 
set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification.&quot;<br>
<br>
Orwell's essay, written in 1946, has done little to discourage the 
powers-that-be from substituting mild or vague expressions for harsh or blunt 
ones. An air attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh once admonished 
reporters: &quot;You always write it's bombing, bombing, bombing. It's not bombing. 
It's air support.&quot; In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan dubbed the MX missile the 
&quot;Peacekeeper,&quot; in hopes of making the controversial nuclear weapon more 
palatable. The Clinton administration's end to &quot;welfare as we know it&quot; has 
ushered in &quot;job centers&quot; instead of welfare offices; &quot;financial planners&quot; 
instead of caseworkers; and &quot;job seekers&quot; instead of welfare recipients.<br>
<br>
In the corporate world, euphemism allows boardroom bullies to call massive 
firings layoffs, downsizing, rightsizing, and reshaping. (Digital Equipment 
Corporation once resorted to the patently ridiculous involuntary methodologies. 
One plant shutdown at General Motors was a volume-related production-schedule 
adjustment.) Such euphemism is merely a cowardly attempt by bosses to 
depersonalize the firing process, a code way of saying &quot;Blame the organization, 
not me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Even salesmen in this age of telemarketing wrap themselves in euphemisms: the 
Willy Lomans of yesteryear are now advisors, associates, specialists, 
consultants, customer service representatives, and, in the case of United 
Airlines, employee owners. Speaking of airlines, have you noticed how filled 
with euphemism airlinespeak is? Nothing is free, but everything is 
&quot;complimentary.&quot; Instructions are &quot;friendly reminders.&quot; Your buoyant cushion is 
&quot;a flotation device.&quot;<br>
<br>
Euphemisms are for wimps. Invented in an attempt to avoid offending others or to 
pussyfoot around socially prickly subjects, they are the last words you should 
resort to if you're trying to be clear, concrete, concise, and compassionate. 
Euphemism conceals reality rather than revealing it— which is, after all, what a 
writer should be doing.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Poke fun at euphemisms whenever you can, as did H. L. Mencken when he was 
implored to create a euphemism for strip-teasing.<br>
<br>
&#65532;We hate euphemisms, but<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Now, lest you still think nouns are too crisp and concrete to have fun with, 
lest you think paring down the pap leads only to the stuff of serious 
description, let's turn to Tom Wolfe, a writer who based an entire journalistic 
career on bending rules. Wolfe found nouns irresistible in a story on supermodel 
Baby Jane Holzer. &quot;The Girl of the Year,&quot; which ran in New York in 1964, opened 
with a breathless noun frolic:<br>
<br>
Bangs manes bouffant beehives Beatle caps butter faces brush-on lashes decal 
eyes puffy sweater French bras flailing leather blue jeans stretch pants stretch 
jeans honeydew bottoms eclair shanks elf boots ballerinas Knight slippers, 
hundreds of them, these flaming little buds, bobbing and screaming, rocketing 
around inside the Academy of Music Theater underneath that vast old moldering 
cherub dome up there— aren't they super-marvelous!<br>
<br>
Homely adjectives and prepositions hardly dare to show their faces in that 
paragraph; the one verb that sneaks in— are— is practically a wallflower.<br>
<br>
Practitioners of the New Journalism aren't the only ones to flout the rules and 
flaunt their wit. The flacks at Cyan Inc., the company that produced the 
adventure-game-to-end-all-adventure-games, Myst, showed a better sense of words— 
and humor— than most PR types, avoiding the knee-jerk tendency to drown crucial 
words in a tide of filler. If all press releases were so funny, editors might 
actually read them. Here's what landed on the desk of an editor at Wired 
magazine. The press release focused all attention on a few key nouns (i.e., the 
names of the products being hawked) and poked fun at meaningless PR.<br>

<br>
Pronouns<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
Pronouns are proxies for nouns. They stand in willingly when nouns don't want to 
hang around sounding repetitive. The noun (or noun phrase), whose bidding the 
pronoun does, is called the antecedent— because it goes (ced-) before (ante-) 
the pronoun in the sentence or paragraph.<br>
<br>
Unlike nouns, a class of words that is forever morphing and mutating, the list 
of pronouns is finite and predictable, subdividing neatly and changed only 
slightly since the days of Shakespeare:<br>
<br>
• Personal pronouns might be the subject of a sentence (I, you, he, she, it, we, 
they) or the object (me, you, him, it, us, them): &quot;I come to bury Caesar, not to 
praise him.&quot; Certain personal pronouns (my, your, his, her, its, our, their) 
double as adjectives, since in indicating possession they modify nouns: 
&quot;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.&quot;<br>
<br>
• Demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those) direct attention to another 
word or phrase. They can be nouns: &quot;This was the most unkindest cut of all.&quot; 
They can be adjectives: &quot;If we do meet again, why, we shall smile; If not, why 
then, this parting was well made.&quot;<br>
<br>
• Relative pronouns (that, what, whatever, which, whichever, who, whoever, whom, 
whomever, whose) introduce a clause that wants to hitch itself firmly to its 
antecedent: &quot;The evil that men do lives after them.&quot; The antecedent can be a 
noun, a phrase, a clause, a sentence, or even a whole paragraph.<br>
<br>
• Indefinite pronouns (all, another, any, anybody, anything, both, each, either, 
every, everybody, everyone, everything, few, many, most, much, neither, no one, 
nobody, none, one, several, some, somebody, someone, something, such) also stand 
in for people or things, but not necessarily ones specifically named by an 
antecedent: &quot;If any, speak; for him have I offended.&quot; Indefinite pronouns move 
around sentences with abandon and can also play the role of adjectives. (Take 
care to see indefinite pronouns for what they are, because they make 
subject-verb agreement quite dicey. But more on that in chapter 9.)<br>
<br>
• Interrogative pronouns (what, which, who, whom, whose) kick off questions: 
&quot;What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?&quot;<br>
<br>
• Expletive pronouns (it, there) are less sexy than they sound, stepping into a 
sentence as subject when the juice of the sentence lurks in the predicate: 
&quot;There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats.&quot;<br>
<br>
• Reflexive pronouns (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, 
yourselves, themselves) allow a person or thing to be both the subject and the 
object of a sentence (&quot;I have o'ershot myself to tell you of [Caesar's will]&quot;) 
or add emphasis (Marc Antony himself didn't need emphasis in his famous speech. 
That should tell you something.)<br>
<br>
Reflexive pronouns deserve a caveat: Sometimes they are absolutely necessary for 
clarity, distinguishing, for example, in the following non-Shakespearean 
sentence, between two possible antecedents (May and April): &quot;As May sashayed 
through the yard, April wondered whether she herself would ever again have the 
upper hand.&quot; But novices most often use reflexive pronouns when a personal 
pronoun would be simpler and more elegant (not to mention more correct): &quot;Jim 
and myself, however, were holding out for June&quot; is hardly a studly sentence; 
June would prefer &quot;Jim and I.&quot;<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
PRONOUNS MAY SEEM PUNY next to their heftier kin, and some writers might 
initially view them as too generic, too homely to put much faith in. But 
sometimes their very simplicity is their strength. Jacobo Timerman shows how 
powerful they can be in the opening to Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a 
Number (see opposite page).<br>
<br>
The stark plainness of Timerman's I and He complements the dreariness of his 
nouns. He repeats the simple pronoun I again and again, giving it the strongest 
position in the sentence: the subject. This repetition makes the sudden 
appearance of He all the more startling and powerful. Timerman has also 
exploited the anonymity of I and He— those bare pronouns, lacking antecedents, 
fit perfectly in a book about nameless prisoners.<br>
<br>
The passage cited in chapter 1 continues with these pronoun-driven paragraphs:<br>
<br>
Tonight, a guard, not following the rules, leaves the peephole ajar. I wait a 
while to see what will happen but it remains open. Standing on tiptoe, I peer 
out. There's a narrow corridor, and across from my cell I can see at least two 
other doors. Indeed, I have a full view of two doors. What a sensation of 
freedom!…<br>
<br>
My entire forehead is pressed against the steel and the cold makes my head ache. 
But it's been a long time— how long?— without a celebration of space. I press my 
ear against the door, yet hear no sound. I resume looking.<br>
<br>
He is doing the same. I suddenly realize that the peephole in the door facing 
mine is also open and that there's an eye behind it. I'm startled: They've laid 
a trap for me. Looking through the peephole is forbidden and they've seen me 
doing it. I step back and wait. I wait for some Time, more Time, and again more 
Time. And then return to the peephole.<br>
<br>
He is doing the same.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
Pronouns keep style succinct, allowing us to skirt the needless repetition of 
nouns. In prose, pronouns also establish the voice of the narrator, offering the 
writer the opportunity to play with point of view.<br>
<br>
The third-person pronouns (he, she, it, they) allow the narrator to recede. In 
the most common point of view in fiction, the &quot;third-person omniscient,&quot; the 
author is allowed to see into the heads of characters, to relay their thoughts 
to readers, without necessarily being a character in the story. In nonfiction, 
the third-person point of view is not so much omniscient as objective. It's the 
preferred point of view for reports, research papers, or articles about a 
specific subject or cast of characters. It's best for business missives, 
brochures, and letters on behalf of a group or institution. See how a slight 
shift in point of view creates enough of a difference to raise eyebrows over the 
second of these two sentences: &quot;Victoria's Secret would like to offer you a 
discount on all bras and panties.&quot; (Nice, impersonal third person.) &quot;I would 
like to offer you a discount on all bras and panties.&quot; (Hmmm. What's the intent 
there?)<br>
<br>
In today's culture of confession, many writers prefer the first-person point of 
view. Unabashed subjectivity may be fine for ever-popular memoirs on incest and 
inside-the-Beltway intrigue, but the third-person point of view remains the 
standard in news reporting and writing that aims to inform, because it keeps the 
focus off the writer and on the subject. The following Associated Press report, 
dictated in 1957 by Remain Morin from a phone booth across from Little Rock's 
Central High School, shows how the third person can lead to both power and 
emotion:<br>
<br>
The eight Negroes— the three boys and five girls— were crossing the schoolyard 
toward a side door at the south end of the school. The girls were in bobby socks 
and the boys were dressed in shirts open at the neck.<br>
<br>
They were not running, not even walking fast. They simply strolled toward the 
steps, went up and were inside before all but a few of the 200 people at the end 
of the street knew it.<br>
<br>
&quot;They've gone in,&quot; a man roared. &quot;Oh, God, the niggers are in the school.&quot;<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, the first-person point of view comes most naturally and 
lets the narrator be an integral part of the story. Sometimes it's time to 
loosen your tie, to get personal. In a 1976 address at the University of 
California at Berkeley called &quot;Why I Write,&quot; Joan Didion made a persuasive case 
for the first person:<br>
<br>
Of course I stole the title for this talk from George Orwell. One reason I stole 
it was that I like the sound of the words: Why I Write. There you have three 
short unambiguous words that share a sound, and the sound they share is this:<br>
<br>
I<br>
<br>
I<br>
<br>
I<br>
<br>
In many ways writing is the act of saying I, of imposing oneself upon other 
people, of saying listen to me, see it my way, change your mind. It's an 
aggressive, even a hostile act. You can disguise its aggressiveness all you want 
with veils of subordinate clauses and qualifiers and tentative subjunctives, 
with ellipses and evasion— with the whole manner of intimating rather than 
claiming, of alluding rather than stating— but there's no getting around the 
fact that setting words on paper is the tactic of a secret bully, an invasion, 
an imposition of the writer's sensibility on the reader's most private space.<br>
<br>
In her journalism, Didion packs her reporting with the acute— and indispensable— 
detail of personal observation, and she uses the self as a mirror on the times. 
In the title essay of her book The White Album, Didion recalls a period— between 
1966 and 1971— when, she says, she &quot;began to doubt the premises of all the 
stories I had ever told myself, a common condition but one I found troubling.&quot;<br>
<br>
Didion does not use the first person because it's easy, nor does she use it out 
of a rampantly narcissistic need to write about herself. She puts herself into 
service to explore a subject very much outside herself: &quot;the summer of 1968.&quot; 
The first-person in Didion's essay is not tantamount to writing-as-confessional; 
it is a way to link the schism in her own soul to the schism in society. It is 
an example of what Hemingway called writing &quot;hard and clear about what hurts.&quot;<br>
<br>
During those five years I appeared, on the face of it, a competent enough member 
of some community or another, a signer of contracts and Air Travel cards, a 
citizen: I wrote a couple of times a month for one magazine or another, 
published two books, worked on several motion pictures; participated in the 
paranoia of the time, in the raising of a small child, and in the entertainment 
of large numbers of people passing through my house; made gingham curtains for 
spare bedrooms, remembered to ask agents if any reduction of points would be 
pari passu with the financing studio, put lentils to soak on Saturday night for 
lentil soup on Sunday, made quarterly F.I.C.A. payments and renewed my driver's 
license on time, missing on the written examination only the question about the 
financial responsibility of California drivers. It was a time of my life when I 
was frequently &quot;named.&quot; I was named godmother to children. I was named lecturer 
and panelist, colloquist and conferee. I was even named, in 1968, a Los Angeles 
Times &quot;Woman of the Year,&quot; along with Mrs. Ronald Reagan, the Olympic swimmer 
Debbie Meyer, and ten other California women who seemed to keep in touch and do 
good works. I did no good works but I tried to keep in touch. I was responsible. 
I recognized my name when I saw it….<br>
<br>
This was an adequate enough performance, as improvisations go. The only problem 
was that my entire education, everything I had ever been told or had told 
myself, insisted that the production was never meant to be improvised: I was 
supposed to have a script, and had mislaid it. I was supposed to hear cues, and 
no longer did. I was meant to know the plot, but all I knew was what I saw: 
flash pictures in variable sequence, images with no &quot;meaning&quot; beyond their 
temporary arrangement, not a movie but a cutting-room experience. In what would 
probably be the middle of my life I wanted still to believe in the narrative and 
in the narrative's intelligibility, but to know that one could change the sense 
with every cut was to begin to perceive the experience as rather more electrical 
than ethical.<br>
<br>
During this period I spent what were for me the usual proportions of time in Los 
Angeles and New York and Sacramento. I spent what seemed to many people I knew 
an eccentric amount of time in Honolulu, the particular aspect of which lent me 
the illusion that I could any minute order from room service a revisionist 
theory of my own history, garnished with a vanda orchid. I watched Robert 
Kennedy's funeral on a verandah at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Honolulu, and 
also the first reports from My Lai. I reread all of George Orwell on the Royal 
Hawaiian Beach, and I also read, in the papers that came one day late from the 
mainland, the story of Betty Lansdown Fouquet, a 26-year-old woman with faded 
blond hair who put her five-year-old daughter out to die on the center divider 
of Interstate 5 some miles south of the last Bakersfield exit. The child, whose 
fingers had to be pried loose from the Cyclone fence when she was rescued twelve 
hours later by the California Highway Patrol, reported that she had run after 
the car carrying her mother and stepfather and brother and sister for &quot;a long 
time.&quot; Certain of these images did not fit into any narrative I knew.<br>
<br>
Another flash cut:<br>
<br>
&quot;In June of this year patient experienced an attack of vertigo, nausea, and a 
feeling that she was going to pass out. A thorough medical evaluation elicited 
no positive findings and she was placed on Elavil, Mg 20, tid…. The Rorschach 
record is interpreted as describing a personality in process of deterioration 
with abundant signs of failing defense and increasing inability of the ego to 
mediate the world of reality and to cope with normal stress…. Emotionally, 
patient has alienated herself almost entirely from the world of other human 
beings. Her fantasy life appears to have been virtually completely preempted by 
primitive, regressive libidinal preoccupations, many of which are distorted and 
bizarre…. Patient's thematic productions on the Thematic Apperception Test 
emphasize her fundamentally pessimistic, fatalistic, and depressive view of the 
world around her. It is as though she feels deeply that all human effort is 
foredoomed to failure, a conviction which seems to push her further into a 
dependent, passive withdrawal. In her view she lives in a world of people moved 
by strange, conflicted, poorly comprehended, and above all, devious motivations 
which commit them inevitably to conflict and failure….&quot;<br>
<br>
The patient to whom the psychiatric report refers is me. The tests mentioned— 
the Rorschach, the Thematic Apperception Test, the Sentence Completion Test, and 
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Index— were administered privately, in the 
outpatient psychiatric clinic at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, in the 
summer of 1968, shortly after I suffered the &quot;attack of vertigo and nausea&quot; 
mentioned in the first sentence and shortly before I was named a Los Angeles 
Times &quot;Woman of the Year.&quot; By way of comment I offer only that an attack of 
vertigo and nausea does not now seem to me an inappropriate response to the 
summer of 1968.<br>
<br>
THE FIRST-PERSON PLURAL PRONOUN, we, is less common— and certainly less 
aggressive— than Didion's spearlike I. We includes the reader in the experience 
described. In The Medusa and the Snail, the physician Lewis Thomas reaches out 
to his reader by choosing the pronoun we:<br>
<br>
We are a spectacular, splendid manifestation of life. We have language…. We have 
affection. We have genes for usefulness, and usefulness is about as close to a 
&quot;common goal of nature&quot; as I can guess at. And finally, and perhaps best of all, 
we have music.<br>
<br>
By extending his point of view from I (the author/physician) to we (all of us), 
Thomas broadens his subject from biology to the human condition.<br>
<br>
It's rare to see the first-person plural in fiction, but Suketu Mehta uses we to 
great effect in the short story &quot;Gare du Nord&quot;:<br>
<br>
After we left the restaurant, we walked around outside the Gare du Nord. It was 
a Tuesday night, and we were the only people out, but we were in such good 
spirits that we were a crowd all by ourselves; we made the street feel 
inhabited. The buildings around the Gare du Nord are filled with immigrants; it 
is as if having come off the train from their distant homes, they were so 
exhausted by the journey that they put bag and baggage down in the first empty 
room they saw. It is not a pretty area, and the noise of trains and cars 
consumes the neighborhood from an early hour. But maybe what keeps the 
immigrants in the area is the knowledge that the first door to home is just 
there, in the station, two blocks away. The energy of travelers is comforting, 
for it makes us feel that the whole world, like us, is transient.<br>
<br>
Mehta never actually reveals who the we is, though, clearly, it is less 
universal than Lewis Thomas's. At times we seems to refer to a single person, at 
times it refers to a couple, at times it refers to the entire expatriate 
community of Paris.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
THE SECOND-PERSON PRONOUN (you) lets the author hook the reader as if in 
conversation. Call it cozy. Call it confiding. You is a favorite of the Plain 
English folks, who view it as an antidote to the stiff impersonality of legalese 
and urge bureaucrats to write as if speaking to the public.<br>
<br>
Pauline Kael, unlike most film critics of her time, frequently used the second 
person to enliven her reviews:<br>
<br>
• From a review of The French Connection: &quot;The panhandler in the movie who 
jostles the hero looks just like the one who jostles you as you leave the movie 
theatre.&quot;<br>
<br>
• From a review of Last Tango in Paris: &quot;It is a movie you can't get out of your 
system, and I think it will make some people very angry and disgust others.&quot;<br>
<br>
• From a review of Platoon: &quot;There are too many scenes where you think, It's a 
bit much. The movie crowds you; it doesn't give you room to have an honest 
emotion.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second-person point of view gives Kael's reviews urgency and intimacy. 
Fellow New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik called Kael's point of view the 
&quot;complicitous&quot; second person, explaining: &quot;It wasn't her making all those 
judgments. It was the Pop Audience there beside her.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second-person point of view is rarer in fiction and long-form nonfiction 
narrative. But Jay McInerney used it in Bright Lights, Big City, implicating the 
reader (&quot;you&quot;) in the cocaine-fueled antics of the main character, Jamie:<br>
<br>
You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of 
morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely 
unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy. You are at a nightclub talking to a 
girl with a shaved head. The club is either Heartbreak or the Lizard Lounge. All 
might come clear if you could just slip into the bathroom and do a little more 
Bolivian Marching Powder. Then again, it might not. A small voice inside you 
insists that this epidemic lack of clarity is a result of too much of that 
already. The night has already turned on that imperceptible pivot where two A.M. 
changes to six A.M. You know this moment has come and gone, but you are not yet 
willing to concede that you have crossed the line beyond which all is gratuitous 
damage and the palsy of unraveled nerve endings. Somewhere back there you could 
have cut your losses, but you rode past that moment on a comet trail of white 
powder and now you are trying to hang on to the rush. Your brain at this moment 
is composed of brigades of tiny Bolivian soldiers. They are tired and muddy from 
their long march through the night. There are holes in their boots and they are 
hungry. They need to be fed. They need the Bolivian Marching Powder.<br>
<br>
The longer the creative work, the harder it is to carry off the second-person 
point of view. Using it might provoke reader revolt: &quot;Hey, dude, I have better 
sense than to cave to the Bolivian Marching Powder.&quot; As Bright Lights, Big City 
progresses and the novelty wears off, the reader identifies less and less with 
Jamie, and the second-person comes to seem contrived and false; it's definitely 
Jamie, not &quot;you,&quot; who's self-destructing.<br>
<br>
Taking advantage of pronouns as a literary device is not a light undertaking: in 
choosing a point of view, the writer must make sure it's true, appropriate to 
the story being told. Does the presence of the writer in the story add critical 
color, perspective, and insight? Or is the novice who is tempted to use I just 
being self-indulgent? Don't use pronouns to, in the words of writer Jack Beatty, 
gratuitously drape your own attitudes onto others &quot;as if they were rhetorical 
tailor's dummies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
PRONOUNS ON THE LOOSE.<br>
<br>
Keeping pronouns straight is as important to writing as keeping a firm hand on 
the rudder is to sailing. Your biggest problems with pronouns will come if you 
lose sight of the antecedent: when a pronoun drifts away from its antecedent, 
the entire meaning gets lost at sea.<br>
<br>
When the actress Jane Alexander mused about her tenure as head of the National 
Endowment for the Arts, she committed the Gaffe of the Shifting Pronoun: &quot;I am 
sure there are always things one could have done differently,&quot; she conceded, 
&quot;but I really think I did at least a couple of things right, mostly out of 
instinct.&quot; Notice how &quot;one&quot; made some missteps, yet &quot;I&quot; chose the instinctually 
correct course?<br>
<br>
The use of one to deflect culpability is a classic pronoun cop-out. One is also 
brought in when people feel insecure about an opinion, or just when they want to 
sound portentous: &quot;One finds oneself unable to abide McInerney's choice of 
pronoun, not to mention his character's behavior.&quot; Nonacademic writers not 
self-confident enough to use I and not presumptuous enough to speak for we also 
take recourse in the neutral, neutered, and nonspecific one. But this is 
fraudulent: it's a way for people to pretend they're not being solipsistic by 
being incomparably stuffy.<br>
<br>
&#65532;When Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan discovered that George Bush was 
constitutionally unable to use the pronoun I<br>
<br>
Another pronoun that will take you straight into the bloviator zone is the royal 
we. In 1990, Vice President Quayle answered a TV interviewer's invitation to 
come again with &quot;We will.&quot; Can anyone explain why a pronoun adopted by British 
monarchs has been so warmly embraced by candidates in our anti-monarchic, 
once-Anglophobic democracy?<br>
<br>
Editors also use the royal we (calling it &quot;the editorial we&quot;). Remember all 
those &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; pieces in the pre-Tina New Yorker? Lesser mortals— and 
writers not yet in New Yorker nirvana— might want to heed Mark Twain's advice: 
&quot;Only presidents, editors, and people with tapeworms ought to have the right to 
use we.&quot;<br>
<br>
EATING YOUR ITS AND THEYS.<br>
<br>
Remember, pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number, person, and 
gender. The most common pronoun-antecedent sin happens when writers use they 
instead of it when referring to a singular body. This happens often in speech 
and, therefore, in quotes— like this one by Senator Patrick Leahy in July 1998, 
urging independent counsel Kenneth Starr to conclude his investigation of Bill 
Clinton: &quot;Let the Congress act whichever way they want. But wrap this sucker 
up.&quot; With &quot;the Congress&quot; as the antecedent in that first sentence, the pronoun 
should have been it. But who can't forgive Pat for being blunt?<br>
<br>
Such pronoun gaffes may be common in speech, but they are not kosher in writing. 
William Safire, in his annual Bloopie Awards column in the New York Times 
Magazine, puts the noose around Madison Avenue goofs in the pronoun-antecedent 
department:<br>
<br>
• &quot;British Airways is encouraging any passenger who can say that their business 
class isn't the most comfortable in the air to write and tell them why.&quot; (The 
admen started out right, matching British Airways with the singular verb is. But

&quot;DO YOUR CHILD A FAVOR; TEACH THEM GRAMMAR.&quot;<br>
<br>
Increasingly, writers defend pairing the plural they with a singular antecedent. 
Maybe it's just laziness, maybe it's misguided political correctness. In our dim 
patriarchal past, the masculine pronoun he was routinely used to replace nouns 
like &quot;the president,&quot; &quot;the CEO,&quot; and &quot;the entrepreneur.&quot; In the days of bad-girl 
businesswomen like Madonna, he is a nonstarter.<br>
<br>
But solving the problem by pasting in they or them just invents a new one. Here 
are some horrid examples plucked from papers around the country:<br>
<br>
• He or she who laughs loudest around the watercooler may not be who they say 
they are.<br>
<br>
• Do your child a favor; teach them grammar.<br>
<br>
• Our society has gotten to the point where each person does what's right in 
their own eyes.<br>
<br>
• A motorcyclist has the right to decide if they want to wear a helmet.<br>
<br>
No real wordsmith ever meets a sentence that can't be gracefully recast. Resist 
replacing they with he/she— real people don't speak in slashes. Do make the 
antecedent plural and use they with a vengeance. Don't be afraid of an 
occasional he or she, awkward though it may be. Or take the ultimate judicious 
approach: some U.S. Supreme Court justices alternate between he and she when 
they write their decisions.<br>
<br>
LOOSEY-GOOSEY REFERENCES.<br>
<br>
&quot;The ladies of the church have cast off clothing of every kind, and they can be 
seen in the church basement Friday afternoon.&quot; This doozy, culled by Richard 
Lederer from a church bulletin, is an instance of &quot;obscure pronomial reference,&quot; 
or, in plain English, a pronoun without a clear companion noun. Does they refer 
to &quot;the ladies&quot;? Or to &quot;clothing&quot;? Or to &quot;items of clothing&quot;?<br>
<br>
You, the author, step into the &quot;obscure pronomial reference&quot; trap when you 
assume the antecedent is obvious. It may not be to your reader or listener. 
Often this happens when two separate nouns immediately precede the pronoun, as 
in this snippet of dialogue from Arcadia, a Tom Stoppard play:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
Although the line draws a laugh from a theater audience, Lady Croom should have 
just used a proper noun rather than he.<br>
<br>
It's OK for an antecedent to be supplied by the context of a sentence, so long 
as clarity isn't compromised. But don't assume the last-named object or idea is 
the noun the pronoun replaces. An idea or noun implied but not specifically 
stated can be an antecedent, but referring to it with it can send the wrong 
message: If I told you that you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against 
me?<br>
<br>
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND, UH, ER….<br>
<br>
When pronouns play the role of subject in a sentence or clause, they appear in 
the nominative case (I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they). When they play the 
role of objects in a sentence— objects of a verb or of a preposition— they 
appear in the objective case (me, you, him, her, it, us, you, them). Mixing the 
cases is a common blunder. Ernest Hemingway— no doubt so flummoxed by gender 
issues that he lost track of his cases— erred in writing to Sherwood Anderson in 
1922, &quot;Gertrude Stein and me are just like brothers.&quot; Hemingway shoulda used an 
I.<br>
<br>
It's not uncommon, especially in some regional dialects or street speech, to use 
the objective pronoun as the subject (&quot;Us girls went cruising&quot;), but it's more 
common to do what Hemingway did: to flub the pronouns when they appear as part 
of a compound. Especially common is what the inimitable Fowler's calls &quot;the 
regrettable&quot; between you and I. &quot;Anyone who uses that phrase,&quot; warns Fowler's, 
&quot;lives in a grammarless cavern.&quot;<br>
<br>
Put Mark Twain in that cavern: he regularly relied on between you and I, as in a 
letter written toward the end of the Innocents Abroad voyage: &quot;Between you and 
I… this pleasure party of ours is composed of the rustiest, ignorant, vulgar, 
slimy, palm-sing cattle that could be scraped up in seventeen States.&quot;<br>
<br>
Between isn't the only preposition to get folks in pronoun trouble. In an ad for 
a bra &quot;for we full-figured gals,&quot; Jane Russell was led astray; the preposition 
for also mandates the pronoun us. But then, Russell never was known for her 
pronouns.<br>
<br>
WHOMDUNNIT.<br>
<br>
When faced with the two-pronged attack from who and whom, most people start 
waving the white flag. If they toughed it out, though, they'd learn how easy it 
is to conquer these pronouns. Use who when the pronoun is acting as a subject 
(Who is it?) and whom when it is acting as an object (in For Whom the Bell Tolls 
the pronoun is the object of the preposition for).<br>
<br>
We'll get back to who and whom in chapter 10, when we discuss subjects and 
objects, but to tide you over, take these tips from the Wise Old Word Man, 
Jacques Barzun:<br>
<br>
1. Use who whenever the verb form that follows could be wrapped in parentheses 
without changing the sentence: &quot;who (he believed) had been up the mountain.&quot;<br>
<br>
2. Make it whom when you would use him and her and them in place of whom. &quot;Oprah 
knew he?&quot; sounds silly; &quot;Oprah knew who?&quot; should too. Replace he with him and 
who with whom.<br>
<br>
3. Go ahead and use who when the pronoun starts the sentence: &quot;Who do you love?&quot; 
sounds more natural to many people than &quot;Whom do you love?&quot;<br>
<br>
ME, NOT MYSELF, AND I.<br>
<br>
Watch your reflexive pronouns. As Patricia O'Conner writes in Woe Is I, &quot;In the 
contest between I and me, the booby prize often goes to myself.&quot; Why do people 
insist on myself when a simple I or me will do? Adding a reflexive pronoun 
doesn't necessarily add clarity. This classified ad, reprinted in Richard 
Lederer's Anguished English, goofed badly (or bawdily):<br>
<br>
Tired of cleaning yourself? Let me do it.<br>
<br>
WHOSE ON FIRST?<br>
<br>
Some overly loyal writers cannot give up the grammar myth that the relative 
pronoun whose cannot be used for antecedents that are not human. Such folly 
leads to unfortunate constructions like this one:<br>
<br>
A wonder of the ancient world, the Great Library in Alexandria was an edifice in 
the corridors of which resided the papyrus scrolls that amounted to the sum 
total of human knowledge.<br>
<br>
That sentence might have been elegant had the writer subtly changed it:<br>
<br>
A wonder of the ancient world, the Great Library in Alexandria was an edifice 
whose corridors housed the papyrus scrolls that were the sum total of human 
knowledge.<br>
<br>
Speaking of whose, the one truly unforgivable sin that haunts the use of 
pronouns is the confusion of whose with who's and its with it's. Pronouns, when 
they get possessive, act weirdly. We do not say I's, you's, he's, or she's to 
indicate possession, so why would we say who's or it's? Possessive pronouns are 
all apostrophe-less: my, your, his, hers, its. Who's and it's are contractions 
of who is and it is.<br>
<br>

Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Flubbing pronouns is an easy trick when a writer wants to convey colorful 
colloquial speech. Combined with other grammatical gaffes, pronoun-case errors 
smack of the untutored:<br>
<br>
I knowed it was her.<br>
<br>
Me and her was both late.<br>
<br>
If Gomer and them had not of begin kicking.<br>
<br>
Them dogs are us'n's.<br>
<br>
Songwriters play fast and loose with their pronouns to give their songs 
traction— &quot;Just Because She Made Them Goo-Goo Eyes&quot; was a hit in the '30s, and 
years later Paul Simon crooned about &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.&quot;<br>
<br>
Intentionally flubbing your her's and me's isn't the only way for a writer to 
play with pronouns. Earlier in this chapter, you read the warnings about 
overrelying on the confessional first person. In a piece titled &quot;College 
Application Essay,&quot; which appeared first in Literary Cavalcade, then in 
Harper's, and has since circled and recircled the world on the Internet, Hugh 
Gallagher takes the notion of the first-person-singular point of view to 
outlandish lengths. Parodying the shameless self-promotion often on display in 
admissions essays (and, later in life, in résumé cover letters), Gallagher uses 
I to make fun of an entire genre of nonfiction writing.<br>
<br>
3A. ESSAY<br>
<br>
IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE 
APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT 
HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?<br>
<br>
I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been 
known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient 
in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I 
write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread 
water for three days in a row.<br>
<br>
I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles 
up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in 
twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in 
Peru.<br>
<br>
Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a 
small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play 
bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets. I am the subject of numerous 
documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I 
enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical 
appliances free of charge.<br>
<br>
I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics 
worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't 
perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller 
number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey 
with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral 
arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust 
me.<br>
<br>
I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once 
read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had 
time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location 
of every food item in the supermarket. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I 
sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a 
group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not 
apply to me.<br>
<br>
I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, 
to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered 
the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary 
four-course meals using only a Mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning 
clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri 
Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed 
open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.<br>
<br>
But I have not yet gone to college.<br>

<br>
Verbs<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
Verbs add drama to a random grouping of other words, producing an event, a 
happening, an exciting moment. They also kick-start sentences: without them, 
words would simply cluster together in suspended animation, waiting for 
something to click.<br>
<br>
Verbs subdivide into two major classes: Static and Dynamic. The ur-verb, to be, 
is chief among the static verbs, which either express a state of being or 
quietly link starlet nouns and adjectives without demanding a lot of attention. 
To be crops up in various guises, including am, are, is, was, and were. The 
static verbs also include appear, become, seem, prove, and remain, as well as 
verbs that define things in terms of the five senses: look, taste, smell, feel, 
and sound (as in &quot;the following soliloquy sounds serious&quot;).<br>
<br>
In Hamlet's most memorable speech, Shakespeare expressed the heart of the Dane's 
dilemma via the ultimate static verb:<br>
<br>
To be or not to be: that is the question:<br>
<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
<br>
And by opposing end them? To die, to sleep;<br>
<br>
No more; and, by a sleep to say we end<br>
<br>
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
<br>
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br>
<br>
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep;<br>
<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br>
<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>
<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
<br>
Must give us pause.<br>
<br>
Stasis certainly has its place— whether expressed by the infinitives in to be or 
not to be or by the less anxious is and 'tis. But remember: static verbs lack 
punch.<br>
<br>
Dynamic verbs, on the other hand, grab you by the lapels. Hamlet's active verbs 
include suffer, take, end, die, sleep, wish, dream, come, shuffle, and give. 
Some of these dynamic verbs are transitive, meaning that they take a direct 
object (a noun) in expressing a complete action (suffer takes slings and 
arrows). Verbs not taking a direct object to complete the action are called 
intransitive (die and sleep say it all). Don't fret about these verb castes now; 
we'll come back to the transitive and intransitive distinction when we get to 
sentences in Part Two.<br>
<br>
In a third, subordinate class, verbs gather around other verbs, acting as 
accomplices in the action. These auxiliary or &quot;helping&quot; verbs— may, might, 
could, should, would, have, can, must, will, as well as am, are, is, was, were— 
are mere sidekicks, symbiotically attaching themselves to a main verb in a combo 
called a &quot;verb phrase.&quot; Helping verbs exist mainly to conjugate tenses (she was 
lurching, she had been lurching) and to indicate volition (will lurch), 
possibility (can lurch), or obligation (must lurch). They also step in to 
express a negative (she may not lurch), to transform a thought into a question 
(Would she lurch?), and to emphasize (She will lurch, won't she?).<br>
<br>
Because there's much more to say about verbs, two entire appendices are devoted 
to them. Go there if talking about tenses makes you tense, and if words like 
indicative, imperative, and subjunctive put you in a bad mood.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
More than any other part of speech, it is the verb that determines whether a 
writer is a wimp or a wizard. Novices tend to rely on is and other static verbs 
and lose momentum by stumbling into the passive voice (more on that in a 
moment). The pros make strong nouns and dynamic verbs the heart of their style; 
verbs make their prose quiver.<br>
<br>
The first key to exploiting dynamic verbs is simply to use them. For some 
reason, even experienced writers pepper first drafts with forms of be. Nothing 
wrong with that, as long as the writers indulge in many more drafts to go back 
and season the prose with dynamic verbs. Some writers devote one entire rewrite 
to verbs, circling every is and are and trying to replace as many as possible. 
Eventually, dynamic verbs will start flowing from the get-go.<br>
<br>
Another way to tone up prose is to eliminate what's known as &quot;the passive 
voice,&quot; in which the subject of a sentence is being acted upon— by an agent 
named elsewhere in the sentence or left ambiguous— rather than taking the action 
directly. Going back to Shakespeare's soliloquy, when Hamlet says &quot;a 
consummation devoutly to be wished,&quot; the subject, consummation, is receiving the 
action; who's doing the wishing remains unclear. That's the passive voice. By 
contrast, in the active voice, the subject of the sentence is the one acting: in 
&quot;we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks,&quot; it is we who end. The 
active voice is strong, direct, muscular.<br>
<br>
Notice how Wired writer Richard Rapaport worked his verbs to transform a 
description of the setting of the Sandia National Laboratories from a pedestrian 
catalog of nouns into a landscape shimmering with activity. An early draft of 
his &quot;The Playground of Big Science&quot; opened with a mixture of static and dynamic 
verbs, passive and active voice:<br>
<br>
It is nearly noon, on a cool (temperature 66°), dry (humidity 21%), high-desert 
day. The azurescent New Mexican sky hangs languidly over a flat, antediluvian 
landscape. It is broken to the East by the glowering granite of the Sandia 
Mountains and off to the North by the shimmering hills that lie past the Rio 
Grande River, and mount up to the Jemez Mountains and Los Alamos beyond.<br>
<br>
The final, published version of the paragraph banishes the passive. Rapaport 
erased the opening is, promoted adjectives to verbs, and made the mountains 
move:<br>
<br>
At noon on a cool, high-desert day, the azure New Mexican sky hangs languidly 
over a low, antediluvian landscape. To the east the granite of the Sandia 
Mountains glowers darkly; to the north, the hills past the Rio Grande shimmer as 
they rise to meet the Jemez Mountains and Los Alamos beyond.<br>
<br>
DELETING IS AND ARE doesn't suffice. Don't replace versions of to be with just 
any verbs. Be inventive! &quot;She walks through the house&quot; wins points over &quot;She is 
inside,&quot; but why walks when the choices include paces, skips, and skedaddles? 
Why settle for a verb like says when wail, whisper, and insist are waiting to be 
heard?<br>
<br>
Notice how verbs give verve to &quot;Hoppers,&quot; a &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; piece that ran in 
the New Yorker in 1988. Check out the energy and humor that come from the 
various ways urbanites respond to a puddle in the path:<br>
<br>
Ahydrant was open on Seventh Avenue above Twenty-third Street last Friday 
morning, and we stopped on our way east and watched people hop over the water. 
It was a brilliant spring day. The water was a nice clear creek about three feet 
wide and ran along the gutter around the northwest corner of the intersection. A 
gaggle of pedestrians crossing Twenty-third went hop hop hop hop hop over the 
creek as a few soloists jaywalking Seventh performed at right angles to them, 
and we got engrossed in the dance. Three feet isn't a long leap for most people, 
and the ease of it permits a wide range of expression. Some hoppers went a good 
deal higher than necessary.<br>
<br>
Long, lanky men don't hop, as a rule. The ones we saw hardly paused at the 
water's edge, just lengthened one stride and trucked on across— a rather 
flatfooted approach that showed no recognition of the space or occasion. Tall 
men typically suffer from an excess of cool, but we kept hoping for one of them 
to get off the ground. Most of the tall men wore topcoats and carried 
briefcases, so perhaps their balance was thrown off. One tall man in a brown 
coat didn't notice the water and stepped off the curb into fast-flowing Hydrant 
Creek and made a painful hop, like a wounded heron: a brown heron with a limp 
wing attached to a briefcase bulging as if full of dead fish. He crossed 
Twenty-third looking as though his day had been pretty much shot to hell.<br>
<br>
Short, fat men were superb: we could have watched them all morning. A typical 
fat man crossing the street would quicken his step when he saw the creek, and, 
on his approach, do a little shuffle, arms out to the sides, and suddenly and 
with great concentration spring— a nimble step all the more graceful for the 
springer's bulk. Three fairly fat men jiggled and shambled across Twenty-third 
together, and then one poked another and they saw the water. They stepped 
forward, studying the angle, and just before the point man jumped for the curb 
his pals said something, undoubtedly discouraging, and he threw back his head 
and laughed over his shoulder and threw himself lightly, boyishly, across the 
water, followed— boing boing— by the others.<br>
<br>
The women we watched hop the water tended to stop and study the creek and find 
its narrows and measure the distance and then lurch across. They seemed dismayed 
that the creek was there at all, and one, in a beige suit, put her hands on her 
hips and glared upstream, as if to say, &quot;Whose creek is this? This is utterly 
unacceptable. I am not about to jump a creek.&quot; But then she made a good jump 
after all. She put her left toe on the edge of the curb, leaned forward with 
right arm outstretched— for a second, she looked as if she might take off and 
zoom up toward the Flatiron Building— and pushed off, landing easily on her 
right toe, her right arm raised. The longest leap we saw was made by a young 
woman in a blue raincoat carrying a plastic Macy's bag and crossing west on 
Seventh. She gathered herself up in three long, accelerating strides and sailed, 
her coat billowing out behind her, over the water and five feet beyond, almost 
creaming a guy coming out of Radio Shack. He shrank back as she loped past, her 
long black hair and snow-white hands and face right there, then gone, vanished 
in the crowd….<br>
<br>
If you want your writing to hop, try to train yourself to see differently, to 
watch not just for the puddles but for the action and reaction to them: the 
zooming, trucking, and sailing. Rich images develop from the capacity to observe 
subjects in action, even if the action is just breathing.<br>
<br>
No one does this better than New Yorker writer Roger Angell. Notice the verbs in 
this signature piece, &quot;In the Fire,&quot; on baseball's unseen hero, the catcher, 
whose many motions go unnoticed as the fans keep their eyes not on him, but on 
the ball:<br>
<br>
Consider the catcher. Bulky, thought-burdened, unclean, he retrieves his cap and 
mask from the ground (where he has flung them, moments ago, in mid-crisis) and 
moves slowly again to his workplace. He whacks the cap against his leg, 
producing a puff of dust, and settles it in place, its bill astern, with an 
oddly feminine gesture and then, reversing the movement, pulls on the mask and 
firms it with a soldierly downward tug. Armored, he sinks into his squat, 
punches his mitt, and becomes wary, balanced, and ominous; his bare right hand 
rests casually on his thigh while he regards, through the portcullis, the field 
and deployed fielders, the batter, the base runner, his pitcher, and the state 
of the world, which he now, for a waiting instant, holds in sway. The hand dips 
between his thighs, semaphoring a plan, and all of us— players and umpires and 
we in the stands— lean imperceptibly closer, zoom-lensing to a focus, as the 
pitcher begins his motion and the catcher half rises and puts up his thick 
little target, tensing himself to deal with whatever comes next, to end what he 
has begun. These motions— or most of them, anyway— are repeated a hundred and 
forty or a hundred and fifty times by each of the catchers in the course of a 
single game, and are the most familiar and the least noticed gestures in the 
myriad patterns of baseball. The catcher has more equipment and more attributes 
than players at the other positions. He must be large, brave, intelligent, 
alert, stolid, foresighted, resilient, fatherly, quick, efficient, intuitive, 
and impregnable. These scoutmaster traits are counterbalanced, however, by one 
additional entry— catching's bottom line. Most of all, the catcher is invisible.<br>
<br>
Angell packs his paragraph with thirty active verbs and— count 'em— four linking 
verbs. Every writer should adopt this eight to one ratio. Angell uses the 
passive voice twice, with are repeated and are counterbalanced.<br>
<br>
The verbs in &quot;In the Fire&quot; aren't just dynamic, they're high-octane— from whacks 
and dips to sinks and zoom-lensing. Angell, a virtuoso of verbs, is at his most 
inspired with semaphoring, which imagines myriad flag signals as the perfect 
metaphor for the catcher's constantly communicating hands.<br>
<br>
Angell doesn't even let the reader remain static. &quot;Consider,&quot; he demands, &quot;the 
catcher.&quot; Using the imperative voice, he implores the reader to engage. When he 
resorts to the humble to be, Angell does so strategically. That lone is in &quot;The 
catcher is invisible&quot; betrays the craft in the prose: in the moment he means to 
convey &quot;invisibility,&quot; Angell strips the catcher, indeed the sentence, of 
action.<br>
<br>
Angell performs one other verbal sleight of hand: he lets verbs pinch-hit as 
adjectives. The form of an active verb ending in -ing or -ed is known as a 
participle; participles give you another way to load up on action. Angell's 
participles include thought-burdened, armored, balanced, deployed, waiting, 
noticed, and foresighted.<br>
<br>
William Finnegan, in a 1992 New Yorker opus on surfing, uses participles to turn 
waves into swirls of activity. Each of these images, from &quot;The Sporting Scene: 
Playing Doc's Games,&quot; depends upon a participle for its drama:<br>
<br>
onrushing water<br>
<br>
punishing waves<br>
<br>
shifting mountains of water<br>
<br>
twenty-foot splitting tubes<br>
<br>
a rocky, waterfall-threaded scree<br>
<br>
a long, tapering, darkening wall<br>
<br>
the glassy, rumbling, pea-green wall<br>
<br>
the first wall of sandy, grumbling white water<br>
<br>
pulverizing force<br>
<br>
a swift, swooping, surefooted ride<br>
<br>
a vicious, ledging wave<br>
<br>
the final, jacking section<br>
<br>
a maelstrom of dredging, midsized waves<br>
<br>
the thick, pouring, silver-beaded curtain<br>
<br>
Finnegan doesn't stop at participles. He fills his entire story with sentences 
that use active verbs to make inanimate things animate, like this one: &quot;The 
waves seemed to be turning themselves inside out as they broke, and when they 
paused they spat out clouds of mist— air that had been trapped inside the 
truck-size tubes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
WHAT IS IS— AND ISN'T.<br>
<br>
In speaking and informal writing, we naturally gravitate to to be in all its 
incarnations— present tense and past, active voice and passive. But a reliance 
on to be is a sure sign of a novice writer, like this high-school Miss Malaprop, 
whose usages were recorded by Richard Lederer in Anguished English:<br>
<br>
The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. Shakespeare 
never made much money and is famous only because of what he wrote. He lived in 
Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies and errors. In one of 
Shakespeare's plays, Hamlet rations out his situations by relieving himself in a 
long soliloquy. In another, Lady Macbeth tries to convince MacBeth to kill the 
King by attacking his manhood. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroic 
couplet. Romeo's last wish was to be laid by Juliet.<br>
<br>
A dependence on is and its family screams &quot;rough draft&quot;— even if your piece 
escapes the kind of factual errors rampant in the paragraph above. The best 
writers, during the many revisions they put every piece through, go back and 
scrub out every unnecessary is and are.<br>
<br>
THAT BAD, BAD BEING.<br>

A first-cousin sin of is is being. Nine times out of ten, when being appears, it 
makes for an error; the remaining time, it's probably extraneous. Try these 
sentences by high-school composition students:<br>
<br>
• Being that my brother is obese, I'm embarrassed to go out with him. This would 
be less shameful syntax (if an equally shameful sentiment) if written &quot;My 
brother is obese, so I'm embarrassed to go out with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
• My birthday, being April 6, usually falls during Easter vacation. No need for 
being: &quot;My birthday, April 6, usually falls during Easter vacation.&quot;<br>
<br>
• It is a machine which I, being one of the few can operate. To brag about 
skill, try this: &quot;I am one of the few who can operate this machine.&quot;<br>
<br>
• If I could depend on myself for being aware, all of the time, then a license 
might add up to its expectations. Too wordy. Go with &quot;If I could always depend 
on my own awareness, my driver's license might get me somewhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
For the record, here's being used correctly: &quot;Good writers, being aware of the 
pitfalls of weak verbs, avoid being like the plague.&quot;<br>
<br>
DON'T BE PASSIVE— AND DON'T PASS THE BUCK.<br>
<br>
Every style maven since Aristotle has urged writers to use the active voice. Sir 
Arthur Quiller-Couch may have said it most quaintly in 1916: &quot;Eschew the 
stationary passive.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is not hard to do. Almost any sentence can be made active. Take this 
passive line: The coiffeuse was being ogled by the guy whose hair was being 
snipped. See how easy it is to straighten out this tangle of attentions: 
Goldilocks couldn't take his eyes off his coiffeuse.<br>
<br>
Entrepreneurs are, by definition, active types, so how is it that so much 
business writing sags with the passive voice? No letter should go out with the 
phrase It has come to our attention that. &quot;We notice&quot; is much stronger. 
Likewise, CEOs and secretaries should recast every effort is being made into &quot;we 
are trying.&quot; And business reporters shouldn't let any involvement has been 
vigorously denied by the company; a statement will be issued shortly into their 
copy. Better to say &quot;the company denied involvement and will comment soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
The passive voice often crops up intentionally, when the writer or speaker wants 
to blur the relationship between the person committing an action (the &quot;agent&quot;) 
and the action. Politicians and bureaucrats love the passive voice, because it 
gets them off the hook. During the Iran-contra scandal of the 1980s, pundits 
noted that President Reagan was barely able to concede that &quot;mistakes were made&quot; 
in the implementation of his policies. Then, in his 1987 State of the Union 
speech, he got radical: &quot;serious mistakes were made.&quot; The Great Communicator 
never did say who made the mistakes or whether his policy was flawed. Such 
intentional dodges are harder to make active because the agent (the person who 
took the action) is AWOL.<br>
<br>
HYPERACTIVE EDITING.<br>
<br>
Writers and editors can get too literal-minded about &quot;eschewing the stationary 
passive.&quot; They forget that the passive voice does exist for a reason. One 
syntactically challenged slot editor at the Oakland Tribune, sticking adamantly 
to a policy demanding the active voice, changed the screaming, above-the-fold 
headline &quot;I-580 killer convicted&quot; to &quot;Jury convicts I-580 killer&quot; (which 
screamed less loudly, since the stretched-out phrase required a smaller type). 
What do you think the public cared about— the jury's role, or the fact that a 
notorious slaughterer got the slammer?<br>
<br>
The San Francisco Examiner, on the morning after the death penalty was invoked 
in California for the first time in twenty-five years, ran a large photo of 
murderer Robert Alton Harris and a one-word headline, above the fold, in huge 
type and the passive voice: &quot;Executed.&quot; That said it all.<br>
<br>
If you want to keep the focus on a particular subject, you may want to keep that 
person the subject of the sentence, using the passive voice if necessary to do 
so. Don't let your editor fiddle with sentences like this: &quot;Jerry Brown has 
never been able to settle for the Zen life. After being defeated in successive 
presidential campaigns, he set up camp in Oakland and crushed all competition in 
the mayor's race.&quot; The passive voice (after being defeated) works, because the 
agents— Carter and Clinton— are irrelevant to Brown's political resurrection.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if your intention is to emphasize a subject's very passivity, use the 
passive voice, as does Germaine Greer in The Female Eunuch: &quot;The married woman's 
significance can only be conferred by the presence of a man at her side, a man 
upon whom she absolutely depends. In return for renouncing, collaborating, 
adapting, identifying, she is caressed, desired, handled, influenced.&quot;<br>
<br>
COUCH POTATO WRITING.<br>
<br>
Drab linking verbs— sure saboteurs of whatever drama lurks in a sentence— do in 
unsuspecting writers. The worst offenders are seems and appears, the favorites 
of reporters unwilling to commit to a strong idea. In a profile of David Geffen, 
this sentence should have been reverbed:<br>
<br>
Though he preferred to remain above the fray, he didn't seem to have lost his 
gut for pop culture.<br>
<br>
Doesn't &quot;he never lost his gut for pop culture&quot; read better?<br>
<br>
The same thing can happen with feels, looks, smells, sounds, and tastes. Why 
wimp out and say &quot;my job feels rewarding&quot;? Take a stand. Say &quot;it pays off.&quot; (And 
one more point about feels: it is not synonymous with thinks.)<br>
<br>
Although other miscellaneous wimps— does, get, go, has, put— are (technically) 
dynamic verbs, they add almost nothing to a sentence. Look out for verbs that 
convey less action than other words in the sentence, and avoid them:<br>
<br>
Turn &quot;he has a plan to&quot; into &quot;he plans to.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turn &quot;the team had ten losses&quot; into &quot;the team lost ten games.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turn &quot;an accident occurred that damaged my car&quot; into &quot;that teenager bashed my 
Ferrari.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turn &quot;her speech caused me to blush&quot; into &quot;Hearing so many compliments, I 
blushed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, avoid those bulwarks of the bad memo: utilize, prioritize, and 
implement, which fill business writing with fuzz instead of delivering direct 
actions and strong statements. When your imagination fails you, grab a 
thesaurus. And don't gloss over the truth. Why write that the CEO of the 
high-tech startup &quot;is leaving the company&quot; when you can report the brutal truth: 
&quot;she quit in protest.&quot; Or the &quot;vulture capitalists booted her.&quot; Or &quot;her minions 
ousted her in a corporate coup.&quot; Even if you have to check with a lawyer, isn't 
a kick-ass piece of writing worth the effort?<br>
<br>
AIRHEAD ACTION.<br>
<br>
Have you ever pondered those verbs that everyone uses but that make no sense? 
Revolve around, for example, and its cousin center around usually mark desperate 
attempts by unimaginative reporters to sound good. Take this from a report on 
the National Ocean Conference in Monterey, California: &quot;While the issues at the 
conference revolve around economics and politics, as well as science, the high 
public visibility of the ocean is a factor, too.&quot; The earth may very well 
revolve around the sun, but what, exactly, do issues revolve around? Don't say 
&quot;fin-de-siècle corporate innovation centers around Silicon Valley&quot;; that makes 
no sense. Do say &quot;Silicon Valley is the center of fin-de-siècle corporate 
experimentation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sometimes such verbs are called &quot;false limbs,&quot; an apt term for meaningless words 
that a writer grabs onto rather than searching for stronger pillars. Don't pass 
over strong single words, such as break, stop, spoil, and kill, in favor of 
phrases made of a noun or adjective tacked on to some general-purpose verb:<br>
<br>
make contact with &#65532; use call, fax, or email<br>
<br>
exhibit a tendency to &#65532; tend to<br>
<br>
come to an agreement on &#65532; agree<br>
<br>
to cause an investigation to be made with a view to ascertaining &#65532; find out<br>
<br>
will take steps &#65532; will<br>
<br>
does not see his way to &#65532; will not<br>
<br>
is not in a position to &#65532; cannot<br>
<br>
is prepared to inform you &#65532; will tell you<br>
<br>
ACTION, NOT ABSTRACTION.<br>
<br>
Linguists estimate that fully twenty percent of English verbs began life as 
nouns. The best of these conjure vivid images of concrete action— to audition, 
to bayonet, to gel, to moralize, to pocket, to stump, to scalp, and to 
whitewash, for example. NPR language man Geoffrey Nunberg calls this &quot;syntactic 
switch-hitting,&quot; and mentions a brilliant example from a novel in which the 
writer, Bruce Olds, describes blood that &quot;rooster-tails&quot; from a wound. That 
invention does what a verb is supposed to do: it gives an image, conveys an 
action.<br>
<br>
But this is not to say that nabbing the nearest noun beats searching for the 
best verb. Few public figures have engaged in this sin more than Alexander Haig. 
&quot;I'll have to caveat any response, Senator, and I'll caveat that,&quot; Haig said to 
one politician. To another Haig replied: &quot;Not the way you contexted it, 
Senator.&quot; Caveat and context are flat-footed ideas, not fleet-footed actions. 
(When secretary of state nominee Haig appeared at Senate confirmation hearings, 
a British newspaper heralded the attendant linguistic developments: &quot;verbs were 
nouned, nouns verbed, adjectives adverbised&quot; and the secretary-designate 
&quot;techniqued a new way to vocabulary his thoughts so as to informationally 
uncertain anybody listening about what he had actually implicationed.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Haigs do it, headline writers do it, managers do it, lawyers do it. Joseph 
Cammarata, erstwhile attorney for Paula Corbin Jones in her suit against 
President Clinton, uttered this whammy: &quot;I don't think we should word-smith this 
in public.&quot; Some verb inventions work because they convey action through strong 
images:stonewall and launder. But what's the image in wordsmith— beating a word 
over an anvil? Here's another one: feedback, as in &quot;Let me feedback later&quot;? That 
sounds like the function of a machine rather than a bona fide human activity. 
Turning people and things, especially abstractions, into acts often invents 
awkward and imprecise shortcuts that reveal a lack of imagination for verbs, or 
simply a desire to sound more highfalutin than necessary. It takes only a few 
seconds to improve upon a bad verb created out of a vague noun:<br>
<br>
Rather than to access &#65532; try to view<br>
<br>
to author &#65532; to write<br>
<br>
to finalize &#65532; to finish<br>
<br>
to impact &#65532; to touch<br>
<br>
to input &#65532; to enter<br>
<br>
to interface &#65532; to talk<br>
<br>
to prioritize &#65532; to reorganize<br>
<br>
to obsolete &#65532; to outpace or to supersede<br>
<br>
IF THE VERB DOESN'T FIT, YOU MUST ATTRIT.<br>
<br>
Verbs also enter the language through back-formation, the process that gave us 
to rob from robber, to beg from beggar, to diagnose from diagnosis, and to 
babysit from babysitter. This can make for unbridled originality, as when a 
senator from Utah proclaimed &quot;I prefer a polygamist who doesn't polyg to a 
monogamist who doesn't monog.&quot; Some back-formed verbs work because they are 
visual and their sounds evoke the action they describe: crash, hum, plop, poke, 
splat, swagger, waffle, whoosh, zap.<br>
<br>
But beware of back-formations. They can range from the ugly (burgle, from 
burglar) to the awkward (televise, from television) to the downright dastardly, 
like enthuse, liaise, and attrit (&quot;our air strike will attrit their armor&quot;). 
Just because a verb descends from a legitimate noun does not give it a proper 
pedigree.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHEN I SPLIT AN INFINITIVE, GOD DAMN IT, I SPLIT IT SO IT STAYS SPLIT.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thank you, Raymond Chandler. He's right to defend his split infinitives, 
instances in which an overeager adverb or phrase wedges itself mid-infinitive: 
to go is an infinitive; to proudly go is split. Split infinitives are at least 
as old as the fourteenth century. Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote of those &quot;who 
dared to nobly sham&quot;; two centuries later, James Thurber cracked about his New 
Yorker editor, &quot;Ross wants you to for God's sake stop attributing human behavior 
to dogs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even though pedagogues trying to apply Latin grammar to our Anglo-Saxon tongue 
insist the split infinitive is a no-no, they're dead wrong. Copy editors need to 
back down, lest they earn the wrath of a latter-day George Bernard Shaw. In 
1892, the split-infinitive police made the playwright apoplectic. Shaw wrote 
this to the local paper:<br>
<br>
If you do not immediately suppress the person who takes it upon himself to lay 
down the law almost every day in your columns on the subject of literary 
composition, I will give up the Chronicle. The man is a pedant, an ignoramus, an 
idiot and a self-advertising duffer…. Your famous specialist… is now beginning 
to rebuke &quot;second-rate&quot; newspapers for using such phrases as &quot;to suddenly go&quot; 
and &quot;to boldly say.&quot; I ask you, Sir, to put this man out… without interfering 
with his perfect freedom of choice between &quot;to suddenly go,&quot; &quot;to go suddenly&quot; 
and &quot;suddenly to go….&quot; Set him adrift and try an intelligent Newfoundland dog in 
his place.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Sometimes a writer does without other parts of speech altogether, letting a verb 
demand your complete attention: Listen!<br>
<br>
Drivers returning to San Francisco from Lake Tahoe rise through the infamous 
Donner Pass (elevation 7,239 feet) and then begin a steep decline out of the 
Sierra and into the Sacramento Valley. An enormous billboard— &quot;Let 'er drift&quot;— 
tells truckers to use their engines to slow down their big rigs, lest they burn 
out their brakes. (Let drift here is the verb; 'er is that damn truck.)<br>
<br>
Called &quot;the imperative,&quot; this form of a verb is bracing and bold. It lets the 
writer address the reader directly and powerfully.<br>
<br>
Jamaica Kincaid, in a story called &quot;Girl,&quot; makes the literary device her own, 
building one long crescendoing run-on sentence out of a lifetime of commands 
with which a mother tries to shape her daughter. At the heart of this 
poisonously poignant relationship is the verb:<br>
<br>
Wash the white clothes on Monday and put them on the stone heap; wash the color 
clothes on Tuesday and put them on the clothesline to dry; don't walk barehead 
in the hot sun; cook pumpkin fritters in very hot sweet oil; soak your little 
cloths right after you take them off; when buying cotton to make yourself a nice 
blouse, be sure that it doesn't have gum on it, because that way it won't hold 
up well after a wash; soak salt fish overnight before you cook it; is it true 
that you sing benna in Sunday school?; always eat your food in such a way that 
it won't turn someone else's stomach; on Sundays try to walk like a lady and not 
like the slut you are so bent on becoming; don't sing benna in Sunday school; 
you mustn't speak to wharf-rat boys, not even to give directions; don't eat 
fruits on the street— flies will follow you; but I don't sing benna on Sundays 
at all and never in Sunday school; this is how to sew on a button; this is how 
to make a buttonhole for the button you have just sewed on; this is how to hem a 
dress when you see the hem coming down and so to prevent yourself from looking 
like the slut I know you are so bent on becoming; this is how you iron your 
father's khaki shirt so that it doesn't have a crease; this is how you iron your 
father's khaki pants so that they don't have a crease; this is how you grow 
okra— far from the house, because okra tree harbors red ants; when you are 
growing dasheen, make sure it gets plenty of water or else it makes your throat 
itch when you are eating it; this is how you sweep a corner; this is how you 
sweep a whole house; this is how you sweep a yard; this is how you smile to 
someone you don't like too much; this is how you smile to someone you don't like 
at all; this is how you smile to someone you like completely; this is how you 
set a table for tea; this is how you set a table for dinner; this is how you set 
a table for dinner with an important guest; this is how you set a table for 
lunch; this is how you set a table for breakfast; this is how to behave in the 
presence of men who don't know you very well, and this way they won't recognize 
immediately the slut I have warned you against becoming; be sure to wash every 
day, even if it is with your own spit; don't squat down to play marbles— you are 
not a boy, you know; don't pick people's flowers— you might catch something; 
don't throw stones at blackbirds, because it might not be a blackbird at all; 
this is how to make a bread pudding; this is how to make doukona; this is how to 
make pepper pot; this is how to make a good medicine for a cold; this is how to 
make a good medicine to throw away a child before it even becomes a child; this 
is how to catch a fish; this is how to throw back a fish you don't like, and 
that way something bad won't fall on you; this is how to bully a man; this is 
how a man bullies you; this is how to love a man, and if this doesn't work there 
are other ways, and if they don't work don't feel too bad about giving up; this 
is how to spit up in the air if you feel like it, and this is how to move quick 
so that it doesn't fall on you; this is how to make ends meet; always squeeze 
bread to make sure it's fresh; but what if the baker won't let me feel the 
bread?; you mean to say that after all you are really going to be the kind of 
woman who the baker won't let near the bread?<br>
&#65532;&#65532;CHAPTER 4&#65532;<br>
<br>
Adjectives<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
Adjectives are consorts, never attending a party alone, preferring to hook 
themselves on the arm of a sturdy noun. Adjectives modify their companions, 
defining the qualities of the person, place, or thing they're escorting, and 
sharing relevant details whenever possible.<br>
<br>
In chapter 1, we talked about nouns that might be used in place of house. 
Leaving the party and mixing our metaphors as blithely as we would our 
cocktails, we can say that adjectives are the words that make the duplex, dacha, 
or hacienda distinctive, by suggesting the size and shape of the structure 
(boxy, sprawling), the trim around the windows and doors (Victorian, 
postmodern), the color of the siding (cerise, celadon), or the overall effect 
(elegant, hangarlike, downright dingy).<br>
<br>
&quot;Limiting&quot; adjectives include articles (a door, the cellar); possessive nouns 
and pronouns (Benny's bungalow, my favorite color); demonstrative, indefinite, 
and interrogative pronouns (that closet, any bathroom, which window?); and 
numbers (three bidets!).<br>
<br>
Skilled writers play with strings of adjectives to convey someone's character in 
the equivalent of one brushstroke (a mustache-on-upper-lip, black-leather-jacket 
type) or to explore an archetype, as in these sentences from that first salvo of 
'60s feminism, Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex:<br>
<br>
Woman? Very simple, say the fanciers of simple formulas: she is a womb, an 
ovary; she is female— this word is sufficient to define her…. The term &quot;female&quot; 
is derogatory not because it emphasizes woman's animality, but because it 
imprisons her in her sex…. Females sluggish, eager, artful, stupid, callous, 
lustful, ferocious, abased— man projects them all at once upon woman.<br>
<br>
Other parts of speech sometimes dress in adjective-drag. Attributive nouns, for 
example, modify other nouns, giving them a whole new identity: Marlboro country, 
Hammer time, wine bar. Modifiers can also double or triple up on a noun, and 
these compounds are often held together by hyphens, which help distinguish the 
&quot;adjective&quot; from the noun being modified. Bruce Sterling gave us this pileup in 
a Wired story: &quot;Magor is the perfect model of a Czech 
hippie-dissident-tribal-shaman-poet heavy dude.&quot; Hip-hop's Ice Cube gave us this 
rap: &quot;Give me a black goddess sister, I can't resist her / No stringy-haired 
blond-haired pale-skinned buttermilk-complexion-grafted recessive depressive 
ironing-board-backside straight-up-but-straight-down no-frills-no-thrills 
Miss-six-o'clock-subject-to-have-the-itch mutanoid Caucasoid white cave bitch.&quot;<br>
<br>
Generally, adjectives set the stage for the nouns they modify by preceding them, 
with a few notable exceptions:<br>
<br>
• In some established terms— attorney general, body politic, notary public— the 
adjective follows the noun. This is why the plurals seem irregular: in 
attorneys-general and notaries public, it's the first word, the noun, that gets 
the s.<br>
<br>
• Sometimes, writers take poetic license and reverse the usual order of nouns 
and adjectives, as in &quot;Trip the light fantastic&quot; or &quot;The loving hands of the 
Almighty cradled him in bliss eternal.&quot;<br>
<br>
• In sentences, a linking verb can be wedged between the adjective and the noun 
it modifies (the sentence's subject): &quot;I agree that he's lusty, but I never said 
he was indiscriminate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Placement is more important than you might think. Sleep deprivation may cause us 
to ask for &quot;a hot cup of coffee&quot; when we really want &quot;a cup of hot coffee.&quot; When 
a PC somnambulist asks for &quot;an organic cup of coffee,&quot; is he being fussy about 
the kind of mug he wants, or does he mean &quot;a cup of organic coffee&quot;? This 
placement stuff may seem minor, but look what happened when one classified ad 
writer tried to save two short words, two spaces, and one letter by turning &quot;a 
lover of antiques&quot; into &quot;antique lover&quot;: &quot;Four-poster bed, 101 years old. 
Perfect for antique lover.&quot; That writer ended up hawking an accoutrement for a 
creaking Lothario!<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
Are you old enough to remember the 1969 Jell-O commercial by Young &amp; Rubicam 
that built an entire sixty-second sketch around perfect adjectives? A lonely and 
somewhat dorky man in a business suit is sitting at a table in a cafeteria-style 
restaurant. A no-nonsense Laverne look-alike approaches.<br>
<br>
SHE: Dessert?<br>
<br>
HE: Yes! I'd like something cool, like ice cream.<br>
<br>
SHE: Ice cream! (She nods and walks toward the kitchen, writing up the check.)<br>
<br>
HE: But not ice cream.<br>
<br>
SHE: (She returns.) Not ice cream?<br>
<br>
HE: No, I'd like something smooth, like pudding.<br>
<br>
SHE: Pudding!<br>
<br>
HE: Not pudding. (She returns and bends over him, her hand on the table. She's 
got his number now.) Hmmm. Fresh fruit? No. Something light, like chiffon pie?<br>
<br>
SHE: Uh, but not chiffon pie?<br>
<br>
HE: Something refreshing, like sherbet, but… not sherbet. Um. (He sits, 
mumbling, drumming his fingers on the table, looking desperately skyward, as she 
bolts away, returning a few seconds later with a bowl of Jell-O.)<br>
<br>
Your readers may not be as patient— or perceptive— as that early Laverne. Caring 
about precise adjectives is one key to vivid prose, and it's important to 
fine-tune your modifiers before you demand the reader's (or listener's) 
attention.<br>
<br>
Why use the generic yellow, given the options: bamboo, butter, canary, chamois, 
dandelion, jonquil, lemon, maize, mimosa, mustard, ochre, old gold, popcorn, 
saffron, sauterne, turmeric, and yolk? In a story about golden lion tamarins in 
The Rarest of the Rare, Diane Ackerman shows characteristic creativity in 
describing that yellowish monkey as &quot;a sunset-and-corn-silk-colored creature.&quot; 
Elsewhere she describes one male of the species as having &quot;sweet-potato-colored 
legs, a reddish beard and arms, and a chest and belly the tawny gold of an 
autumn cornfield.&quot;<br>
<br>
Every one of Ackerman's adjectives in this description of a monkey named Jenny 
is carefully crafted:<br>
<br>
Golden tufts of fur stick out between her fingers and toes, which have small 
round pads at the base of each claw. Her long, slender fingers were made for 
reaching into narrow places, where insects may lurk. I have seen lithe, graceful 
hands like these in paintings of Thai dancers. Stroking the dark pads on her 
feet, I'm surprised to discover them soft and yielding…. On Jenny's small nose, 
two thin nostrils angle away from each other. A slight, upside-down curve is the 
natural shape of her mouth, as if she were caught in a perpetual pout. Gold 
whiskers sprout from her chin, and a widow's peak of canary yellow leads to a 
full golden mane encircling her head. Her tiny, guitar-pick-shaped tongue, 
flicking in and out, has a deep groove down the center. Golden lion tamarins 
give off a pungent odor. Burying my nose in Jenny's chest, I inhale deeply the 
aroma of hot gingerbread mixed with drenched wheat.<br>
<br>
Ackerman's specific— and unexpected— adjectives mark her finesse as a stylist. 
None of these adjectives are filler words; all enhance her description. They 
give her passages a lushness perfectly appropriate for a story set in the 
Brazilian rain forest and populated by &quot;shy, quick-footed, promiscuous&quot; plants, 
by &quot;swelling purple bougainvillea,&quot; by an &quot;aphrodisiac brew&quot; of pollen, by 
&quot;clutching&quot; and &quot;slime-coated&quot; vines, by &quot;gaudy flowers,&quot; and by the &quot;Saran 
Wrap-like crinkling of leaves.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not all scenes merit lush description, though, and not all adjectives enhance. 
In a New Yorker cartoon, Michael Maslin parodies Madison Avenue's overreliance 
on empty adjectives: Lying on a porch swing with an iced tea nearby, a poor 
mensch indulging in a little summer reading hits this patch of 
adjective-polluted prose: &quot;Night fell over the land like an L. L. Bean navy-blue 
summerweight one-hundred-percent-goose-down-filled comforter covering up an 
Eddie Bauer hunter-green one-hundred-percent-combed-cotton, machine-washable 
king-size fitted sheet.&quot; Ugh!<br>
<br>
Simply using more adjectives is not necessarily better. Be selective. George 
Bush's &quot;kinder, gentler nation&quot; stuck because it was succinct. But it took a 
skilled speechwriter to distill Bush's idea and turn the phrase: Peggy Noonan 
recalls that the adjectives were inspired by a cascade of nouns Bush unleashed 
while brainstorming about the words that carry special meaning for him: &quot;Family, 
kids, grandkids, love, decency, honor, pride, tolerance, hope, kindness, 
loyalty, freedom, caring, heart, faith, service to country, fair play, strength, 
healing, excellence.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's the alchemy of adjectives: boiling down an excess of ideas to the essence 
of a thing, with words that surprise.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
&quot;When you catch an adjective,&quot; Mark Twain once wrote to a twelve-year-old boy, 
&quot;kill it. No, I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them— then the rest will be 
valuable.&quot; At some point, however reluctantly, all writers must disabuse 
themselves of adjectives. We must learn to bring in descriptive terms only 
occasionally, sparingly, and astutely, to avoid the following sins:<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTIVE DOUBLERS AND POSEURS.<br>
<br>
Adjectives often get hauled in to prop up weak, generic, imprecise nouns when 
writers are too lazy to find better ones. The result is imprecision, squared. 
Don't slap on an adjective that merely repeats what the noun or verb makes 
obvious. In &quot;the first vote we'll start with,&quot; first is extraneous. So are the 
adjectives clinging to these nouns: free gift, personal opinion, little baby, 
afternoon matinee, true facts, convicted felon, vast majority, acute crisis, 
grave emergency, serious danger. By the same token, pairing an adjective with a 
noun coined to mean the opposite just leads to confusion: new tradition, 
original copy, partial cease-fire, limited lifetime guarantee, and (a personal 
favorite) tight slacks.<br>
<br>
Back in 1783, Hugh Blair admonished his students at Edinburgh to &quot;Beware of 
imagining that we render style strong or expressive, by a constant and 
multiplied use of epithets. Epithets have often great beauty and force. But if 
we introduce them into every Sentence, and string many of them together to one 
object,… we clog and enfeeble Style; in place of illustrating the image, we 
render it confused and indistinct. He that tells me, 'of this punishing, mutable 
and transitory world' by all these three epithets, does not give me so strong an 
idea of what he would convey, as if he had used one of them with propriety.&quot; 
Updating Blair just a tad, let's put his advice this way: strong nouns create a 
better image than descriptive poseurs. A luau of fruits and fishes is better 
than &quot;a delicious, inviting, attractive spread of food.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seek surprise, paradox, and parody— whether with Shakespearean oxymorons like 
brawling love or more recent inventions like Walter Winchell's lohengrinned 
couple (newlyweds), Betsey Wright's bimbo eruptions, or Candace Bushnell's toxic 
bachelors.<br>
<br>
SHOW, DON'T TELL.<br>
<br>
The most common criticism many writers hear from editors is &quot;show, don't tell.&quot; 
By using this cliché, the editors are usually hinting at an overabundance of 
frothy, emotional adjectives that fail to convey to a reader the experience the 
writer had. &quot;It's no use telling us that something was 'mysterious' or 
'loathsome' or 'awe-inspiring' or 'voluptuous,'&nbsp;&quot; writes C. S. Lewis, reciting 
the editor's standard lecture to the newsroom novice. &quot;By direct description, by 
metaphor and simile, by secretly evoking powerful associations, by offering the 
right stimuli to our nerves (in the right degree and the right order), and by 
the very beat and vowel-melody and length and brevity of your sentences, you 
must bring it about that we, we readers, not you, exclaim 'how mysterious!' or 
'loathsome' or whatever it is. Let me taste for myself, and you'll have no need 
to tell me how I should react.&quot;<br>
<br>
Certain adjectives should be avoided altogether if you want to &quot;show.&quot; George 
Orwell railed against &quot;meaningless words&quot; like romantic, plastic, human, dead, 
living, sentimental, natural, vital; these turn art and literary criticism into 
utter pap. Check out this doozy: &quot;Comfort's catholicity of perception and image, 
strangely Whitmanesque in range, almost the exact opposite in aesthetic 
compulsion, continues to evoke that trembling atmospheric accumulative hinting 
at a cruel, an inexorably serene timelessness.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cultural elite don't have a monopoly on meaningless adjectives. Orwell also 
deplored those favored by politicians trying to &quot;dignify the sordid processes of 
international politics&quot;: epoch-making, epic, historic, unforgettable, 
triumphant, age-old, inevitable, inexorable, veritable. Politicians trying to 
&quot;dignify the sordid processes&quot; of national politics sin, too: &quot;As members of the 
House, you get an opportunity very few times in your career to make a historic 
vote,&quot; said U.S. Representative Martin T. Meehan about the House's doomed 1998 
campaign-finance-reform package. Like a candidate who can't get enough of soft 
money, Meehan couldn't get enough of this soft adjective, adding, &quot;This was a 
historic vote.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then there are the staples of the high-school English paper, which stick around 
to clutter our prose long after we've stopped analyzing The Great Gatsby and 
Romeo and Juliet. These ultimate lightweights describe the reaction of the 
observer rather than the qualities of the thing observed: unique, interesting, 
boring, good, bad, important. Ban these snoozers from your prose, lest you end 
up sounding as silly and insipid as this writer from Commerce:<br>
<br>
Hillary's, a singularly distinctive and unique restaurant, has made a 
well-planned and suspicious début, bringing a special new flavor and excitement 
to the North Jersey scene.<br>
<br>
Add singularly distinctive and special to that list of no-brainers. (Oh, and 
don't you have a slight suspicion that Hillary's début was more auspicious than 
sneaky?)<br>
<br>
PLEASE, SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF.<br>
<br>
Get a grip on these adjectival fine points:<br>
<br>
• Less and fewer. Take a stroll through the nearest grocery with its signs 
screaming &quot;less calories than ice cream&quot; and &quot;Express line: ten items or less.&quot; 
Both phrases use less incorrectly. When talking about a smaller number of things 
(as you are when you're loading your arms with groceries or loading your body 
with calories), use fewer. When you are talking about a smaller quantity of 
something, use less. (Say, for instance, you need less catsup: get the smaller 
bottle.) You would also use less to refer to degree or extent. (If you have less 
patience than ever, buy fewer things and stand in the ten-items-or-fewer line.)<br>
<br>
Wanna get more technical? Fewer is used with countable, or collectible nouns 
(Are your eyes glazing over? Those would be nouns that take an s in the plural): 
fewer burgers, fewer buns. Less is used with uncountable, or mass nouns: less 
mustard, less catsup, less hunger, less indigestion. If you use many with a 
word, use fewer with the same word (many cartons of milk, many shopping bags, 
and fewer cartons of milk, fewer shopping bags); if you use much with a word, 
use less (much food, much hassle, and less food, less hassle).<br>
<br>
• Good and well and bad and badly. It's simple: good and bad are adjectives, 
well and badly are adverbs. (You have an excuse on well and badly, because we 
haven't covered adverbs yet.) Good and bad modify nouns. She's a good dancer, 
but a bad cook. They don't modify verbs, so you'd have to say she dances well 
but cooks badly.<br>
<br>
• That elliptical, photo-caption prose. The articles— a, an, and the— are 
becoming forgotten souls in the fast-moving world of headlines and captions. We 
would never speak without these pipsqueaks, yet writers increasingly abandon 
them. &quot;The very word article means a little joint,&quot; grammarian Jacques Barzun 
writes, noting how these natural links are so &quot;chaotically applied.&quot; In 
headlines like &quot;Train Rams Car,&quot; he adds, &quot;idiom is flouted for brevity&quot; and 
&quot;inelegance&quot; prevails. Equally egregious is the cavalier conversion of 
adjectives into nouns. When &quot;the escaping couple&quot; becomes &quot;escape couple,&quot; all 
meaning escapes the headline. Kingsley Amis, in The King's English, recalls 
competing headlines in two British tabloids that ignored any part of speech 
other than a noun: &quot;School Coach Crash Drama,&quot; screamed one, and &quot;School Outing 
Coach Horror&quot; the other. Amis awards the prize, though, to a headline that 
managed five nouns in a row: &quot;School Bus Belts Safety Victory.&quot;<br>
<br>
MARKETING MADNESS.<br>
<br>
The cheap modifiers in this Gump's catalog copy hardly explain why the item 
they're describing justifies a $115 price tag: &quot;These extraordinary flutes… 
bring a unique design energy to any setting. Masterfully rendered in lifelike 
details in brilliant lead-free pewter wedded with European crystal.&quot; It's not 
those empty adjectives that hint at what you're buying, it's the nouns in that 
last phrase.<br>
<br>
In a misguided effort to be &quot;fresh,&quot; some writers of marketing copy verge on the 
ridiculous. Have you ever studied the syntax of women's clothing catalogs? OK, I 
got it that &quot;aubergine&quot; stockings are gonna make my legs look like eggplants, 
but will &quot;mist&quot; stockings make them disappear? What, exactly, does Spanish Flesh 
look like? Or Cold Morn, Pearly Gates, Kitten's Ear, and Folly?<br>
<br>
The wine industry may have even textiles beat. With all sympathy for oenophiles 
trying to describe sensations on the palate, does anyone think these blurbs from 
a wine magazine help us figure out what a wine will taste like? The Chablis 
Grand Cru Vaudésir 1994, we're told, is &quot;fat, rich, quite heavy, overdone… 
full-bodied and quite mature, as evidenced by its yellow color.&quot; The Alberet 
Boxler Riesling Alsace Grand Cru Sommerberg 1993 is &quot;as fresh and clean as a 
mountain stream. Aromas of wet stones and herbs make way for a racy palate of 
grapefruit and lime. Light but intense, it's a lively match for food.&quot; If you're 
not racy enough to drink wet stones, you might try the J-B. Adam Tokay Pinot 
Gris Alsace 1994: &quot;Thick, almost viscous, yet dry, with herbal and pear flavors. 
Big but inarticulate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Who can't love a wine that doesn't talk back?<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
They can be empty, they can be redundant, they can be fuzzy, they can be silly. 
But when the right adjective catches, it can become a cultural icon. Given a 
brand name that was, effectively, an adjective, TBWA Advertising (now TBWA Chiat 
Day) conceived an ad campaign with endless memorable permutations. Since 1981 
the ad agency has treated us to Absolut Perfection, Absolut Proof, Absolut 
Larceny, Absolut Wonderland, Absolut Joy, Absolut Brooklyn, Absolut Citron, 
Absolut au Kurant, Absolut Warhol, Absolut Avedon, and a host of other 
absolutes.<br>
<br>
Since we've so ruthlessly skewered oenophiles enamored of adjectives, let's 
remember that some grape-squishers do get it right. The winemakers at 
California's Bonny Doon Vineyards know how to mix a little wit with their words. 
Tongue firmly in palate, the scribes at Bonny Doon wildly carom between 
metaphoric parody and over-the-top gushiness in these bits of bottle copy:<br>
<br>
VIN GRIS DE CIGARE: &quot;the thinking person's pink wine&quot;<br>
<br>
PACIFIC RIM GERWÜRTZTRAMINER: &quot;neither too tannic nor Teutonic&quot;<br>
<br>
BIG HOUSE RED: &quot;full-bodied eclectic pan-Mediterranean blend&quot;<br>
<br>
MONTEREY REFOSCO: &quot;rich, plummy with a haunting almond fragrance… enriches the 
world with its unique strangeness&quot;<br>
<br>
BARBERA: &quot;alarmingly rich, dense brambleberry fruit… the perfect accompaniment 
to grilled qualcosa.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for that grilled qualcosa, when your adjectives are working for you, who 
needs nouns?<br>
&#65532;&#65532;CHAPTER 5&#65532;<br>
<br>
Adverbs<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
Adverbs are more promiscuous than adjectives. They partner loosely, modifying 
verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Sometimes, adverbs even modify an entire 
sentence.<br>
<br>
All adverbs express either Time (immediately, now, soon), Place (here, there, 
and everywhere), Manner (boldly, nonchalantly, purposefully), or Degree 
(absolutely, quite, very). Another way to think of adverbs is in terms of the 
questions they answer: When? Where? How? or How much? In &quot;Yesterday, all my 
troubles seemed so far away&quot; the adverb yesterday tells When Paul McCartney's 
troubles seemed so far away. In Ronald Reagan's memorable &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear 
down this wall,&quot; the adverb down modifies the verb, telling Where the wall will 
fall. In the Star Trek preamble, &quot;To boldly go where no one has gone before,&quot; 
the adverb boldly tells How to go. And in Mark Twain's inimitable cable from 
London, &quot;The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated,&quot; greatly tells How 
Much the reports have been exaggerated.<br>
<br>
However, thus, nevertheless, and indeed are adverb hybrids, sharing the DNA of 
both adverbs and conjunctions. Called conjunctive adverbs, they juxtapose fully 
formed ideas, linking muscular independent clauses that might stand alone. Mark 
Twain used the conjunctive adverb whereas in this line: &quot;War talk by men who 
have been in a war is always interesting; whereas, moon talk by a poet who has 
not been in the moon is likely to be dull.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some adverbs, like clearly, basically, seriously, and regrettably, announce 
themselves at the beginning of a sentence and are followed by a throat-clearing 
comma. These words qualify the whole shebang of the sentence and stand in for 
longer, clumsier collections of words. Telegraphing something along the lines of 
&quot;let me speak without one iota of delicacy,&quot; Rhett Butler was as brutally suave 
with a sentence adverb as he was with Scarlett: &quot;Frankly, my dear, I don't give 
a damn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Innocent though they may seem, sentence adverbs can stir wild passions in 
grammarians. By far the likeliest to raise hackles is hopefully, which can 
modify verbs. (&quot;&nbsp;'It's my birthday, you're flush, and I'm hungry,' she hinted 
hopefully&quot;; hopefully tells How she said it, in a hopeful manner.) But everyone 
seems to prefer hopefully as a sentence adverb (&quot;Hopefully, you'll get the hint 
and take me out to dinner&quot;). Some traditionalists disparage the vogue for 
hopefully as a sentence adverb, calling it &quot;one of the ugliest changes in 
grammar in the twentieth century.&quot; Others see in the demise of &quot;I hope that&quot; a 
thoroughly modern failure to take responsibility, and even worse, a contemporary 
spiritual crise, in which we have ceded even our ability to hope.<br>
<br>
Grammarians, get a grip. Hopefully as a sentence adverb is here to stay.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
Adverbs are crashers in the syntax house party. More often than not, they should 
be deleted when they sneak in the back door. Brilliant raconteurs don't recount 
in adverbs, and glorious passages tend to pass on them.<br>
<br>
Adverbs do manage, though, to steal the show every now and then, as in the title 
of the film Truly, Madly, Deeply. Trust the British— the only people who really 
know how to turn actually, absolutely, and indubitably into upper-crust guests— 
to name a movie with adverbs. The title trio comes from a snippet of dialogue in 
which the two main characters play a game of adverbial one-upsmanship:<br>
<br>
NINA:<br>
I love you.<br>
<br>
JAMIE:<br>
I love you.<br>
<br>
NINA:<br>
I really love you.<br>
<br>
JAMIE:<br>
I really truly love you.<br>
<br>
NINA:<br>
I really truly madly love you.<br>
<br>
JAMIE:<br>
I really truly madly deeply love you.<br>
<br>
NINA:<br>
I really truly madly deeply passionately love you.<br>
<br>
JAMIE:<br>
I really truly madly deeply passionately remarkably love you.<br>
<br>
NINA:<br>
I really truly madly deeply passionately remarkably deliciously love you.<br>
<br>
JAMIE:<br>
I really truly madly passionately remarkably deliciously juicily love you.<br>
<br>
(Jamie skipped &quot;deeply&quot; and Nina won the game.)<br>
<br>
Occasionally, Americans pull out a good adverb when it counts. A smart ad for 
Porsche by the agency Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners let the adverb fast carry 
as much weight as the noun: &quot;Kills bugs fast.&quot; Fast is the key word in the 
phrase, leaving no doubt about what makes this sports car soooo different from a 
blast of Raid.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
You may truly, madly, deeply love adverbs, but don't ever drag one in to prop up 
a wimpy verb. Why waste time with &quot;He ran very quickly&quot; when you can say &quot;He 
darted&quot; or &quot;She hightailed it outta there&quot;? Don't use adverbs to bolster 
shopworn adjectives either; doesn't &quot;She's a knockout&quot; knock you out more than 
&quot;She's very pretty&quot;? When you're conducting your adverb audit, beware of the 
most common ways adverbs clutter prose.<br>
<br>
CLIP THOSE HEDGES.<br>
<br>
Strunk and White said it most concisely: Omit needless words. Watch for adverbs 
that merely repeat the meaning of the verb:<br>
<br>
utterly reject<br>
<br>
screeched loudly<br>
<br>
voices aloud<br>
<br>
rudely insulted<br>
<br>
gently caressing<br>
<br>
stumbled awkwardly<br>
<br>
meld together<br>
<br>
All of those verbs are vivid and specific. Set them free.<br>
<br>
On the other end of the bad-adverb scale are those that actually contradict the 
meaning of the verb they are modifying. When President Reagan confessed that he 
was &quot;not fully informed&quot; about the diversion to the Nicaraguan contras of money 
made illegally selling arms to Iran, he was using an adverb as an escape route. 
He wasn't alone: Admiral John M. Poindexter was &quot;not directly involved,&quot; and Don 
Regan was not &quot;thoroughly briefed.&quot; Such claims are no less convincing, William 
Safire pointed out, than the admission of a nonbureaucrat who says she's &quot;a 
little bit pregnant.&quot;<br>
<br>
TOO TOO SULLIED PROSE.<br>
<br>
Hamlet got away with &quot;this too too sullied flesh,&quot; but the rest of us should 
shun adverbs expressing degree. Knee-jerk attempts to add oomph drain a phrase 
of whatever energy it might have had. Rather than using an adverb to bolster a 
weak adjective or verb, search harder for a better word. Say inexpensive instead 
of &quot;pretty reasonably priced,&quot; thrilled instead of &quot;quite happy,&quot; lethargic or 
wiped out instead of &quot;very tired,&quot; and touched instead of &quot;truly moved.&quot; Very 
unique and real unique should be dropped altogether.<br>
<br>
Degree adverbs betray Authorial Laziness— the habit of piling on the first 
flabby words that come to mind rather than finding one supple, strong one. But 
something more egregious is also at work here: Authorial Insecurity. Putting 
words to the page means having the courage of your convictions. &quot;Don't hedge 
your prose with little timidities,&quot; writes William Zinsser in On Writing Well. 
&quot;Good writing is lean and confident…. Every little qualifier whittles away some 
fraction of trust on the part of the reader. Readers want a writer who believes 
in himself and in what he is saying. Don't diminish that belief. Don't be kind 
of bold. Be bold.&quot;<br>
<br>
Certain of these trash adverbs— really, very, too, pretty much, extremely, 
definitely, totally— reflect the mindless banter of surfers, Valley Girls, and 
adolescent mall-mouths. Take, for example, these tidbits from the movie 
Clueless:<br>
<br>
&quot;I, like, totally choked.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Hall was way harsh.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Daddy was way grateful.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's Ren &amp; Stimpy. They are way existential.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Christian is brutally hot.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my god. I'm totally buggin'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Those shoes are so last season.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even some &quot;grown-ups&quot; stay stuck in linguistic adolescence. Casino kaiser Donald 
Trump publicly turned on Governor Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey during 
her reelection campaign, whining, &quot;I was totally a good friend to her, and she 
showed totally no loyalty.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, adults who disabuse themselves of adolescent fluff often replace 
it with pomposity, using adverbs like arguably, basically, certainly, clearly, 
eminently, entirely, essentially, highly, fully, rather, quite, virtually, 
veritably, and wholly. One English rhetorician calls these &quot;adverbial dressing 
gowns&quot;; Sir Alistair Cooke calls them &quot;tics.&quot; Whatever you call 'em, it's 
eminently preferable to stay away from them in prose.<br>
<br>
One of today's worst adverbial offenders is literally— an adverb most often used 
when its exact opposite, figuratively, is meant: You say, &quot;his eloquence 
literally swept the audience off its feet,&quot; and I'm seeing a hall full of felled 
bodies. You write &quot;Mario literally exploded during the argument,&quot; and I see 
prose blown to smithereens.<br>
<br>
ADVERBS SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED AS ADJECTIVES. NOT.<br>
<br>
In the book English As She Is Taught: Being Genuine Answers to Examination 
Questions in Our Public Schools, the nineteenth-century teacher Caroline Bigelow 
Le Row compiled students' fumbling replies to questions about grammar, among 
other subjects. One young citizen offered this bizarre twist: &quot;Adverbs should 
always be used as adjectives and adjectives as adverbs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Schoolchildren aren't the only ones to conflate adjectives and adverbs, 
especially the pairs good/well and bad/badly. But, listen, this isn't rocket 
science. Use well and badly when you're modifying verbs: a new truck runs well 
and a jalopy runs badly. If you're trying to convey the street, go ahead and 
write It runs good. But know that you ought to be saying It runs well.<br>
<br>
&#65532;If you like that piece of English As She Is Taught, you'll love some of the 
others in what Mark Twain dubbed a &quot;darling literary curiosity.&quot;<br>
<br>
LET'S ONLY HAVE EYES FOR ONLY.<br>
<br>
We grant songwriters a lot of license when it comes to grammar, but a prose 
stylist should understand why &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; should be &quot;I have eyes 
only for you.&quot; (The first says &quot;my eyes are the only thing I'll give to you&quot;; 
the second says &quot;my eyes are drawn to you only.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Adverbs, remember, are modifiers. They need to cozy up to the word they modify. 
Check out how moving the adverb only around in the sentence &quot;she told me that 
she fantasized about me&quot; changes the meaning:<br>
<br>
Only she told me that she fantasized about me.<br>
<br>
(i.e., no one else, so far, has admitted it.)<br>
<br>
She only told me that she fantasized about me.<br>
<br>
(i.e., she didn't also write me as much.)<br>
<br>
She told only me that she fantasized about me.<br>
<br>
(i.e., I am the sole stud she's said this to.)<br>
<br>
She told me only that she fantasized about me.<br>
<br>
(i.e., she didn't betray any other thoughts about me.)<br>
<br>
She told me that only she fantasized about me.<br>
<br>
(i.e., she assured me that no one else finds me studly.)<br>
<br>
She told me that she only fantasized about me.<br>
<br>
(i.e., she denied doing anything else, like lingering in the hallway hoping to 
bump into me.)<br>
<br>
She told me that she fantasized about only me.<br>
<br>
(I am the sole object of her attentions!)<br>
<br>
Just make sure, when you use only, that you fantasize about putting it in the 
right place.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Finding writers who devote their energies to making mischief with adverbs takes 
a little scrounging around, but they're out there. Gertrude Stein, ever the 
linguistic contortionist, subverted the adverb there in her famous put-down of 
Oakland: &quot;There is no there there.&quot; The repetition turns the first there into a 
noun. Will Oakland, home of ebonics and other linguistic curiosities, ever 
forgive her?<br>
<br>
Not far from Oakland, the Bonny Doon winery has been doing a little subverting— 
or perverting— of its own. The label of its Bloody Good Red parodies the overuse 
of adverbs and the over-the-top, flushed tone they produce:<br>
<br>
&quot;…astonishingly full-bodied, w/ good, firm backbone yet still rather fleshy, 
esp. about the middle… great legs and a huge and utterly complete nose… 
excruciatingly long &amp; dramatic finish… all in all, I must admit that it really 
was bloody goo….&quot;<br>
<br>
Apple Computer's &quot;Think Different&quot; campaign also subverts the adverb, lopping 
off the final syllable of &quot;Differently.&quot; That skimpy tag line should read Think 
differently, since differently tells us How we should think. But by swapping in 
the adjective different, Apple creates a double entendre: Not only are we 
encouraged to think differently, to make our thinking &quot;iconoclastic&quot; and 
&quot;out-of-the-box,&quot; we are encouraged to think of an Apple computer as different 
from all the others. The sentence reads as if it contained a colon— Think: 
Different.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;CHAPTER 6&#65532;<br>
<br>
Prepositions<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
If you were to compare crafting prose to building a house, the nouns (and 
pronouns), verbs, adjectives, and adverbs would form the foundation, the 
framing, and the ornamentation. Prepositions might be analogous to closet doors. 
From the Latin for &quot;to put before,&quot; a preposition appears before a noun, called 
the &quot;object&quot; of the preposition. The objects of prepositions are closets behind 
the house's doors.<br>
<br>
Prepositions are easy to recognize once you get the hang of it, but here's a 
hunky list to help you out: about, above, across, after, against, ahead of, 
along, among, apart from, around, as, as for, as well as, aside from, at, away 
from, before, behind, below, beside, besides, between, beyond, but, by, by means 
of, down, during, except, for, from, in, in back of, in front of, inside, 
instead of, into, like, near, of, off, on, onto, out, out of, outside, over, 
past, since, through, throughout, till, to, together with, toward, under, until, 
up, up to, upon, with, within, without, with regard to.<br>
<br>
Now, some people might buy a house for its walk-ins, but the closets could never 
be called a house's defining feature. Likewise, prepositional phrases exist to 
modify something more important. Adjectival prepositional phrases modify a noun 
or pronoun: Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown contains two adjectival 
prepositional phrases— on the verge tells us which women we're talking about 
(the ones on the verge) and of a nervous breakdown tells us what they're on the 
verge of. Adverbial prepositional phrases modify a verb, adjective, or adverb: 
In 1964, she wowed the boy next door contains the adverbial prepositional phrase 
in 1964, which tells us when she wowed the boy next door.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Prepositions often convey spatial relationships, telling us where X is in 
relation to Y.<br>
<br>
Prepositions come solo as well as in clusters, and words that normally act as 
prepositions might, depending on the context, act instead as adverbs (inside, as 
in &quot;come inside…&quot;) or conjunctions (&quot;…but don't come too close&quot;). Lone 
prepositions (lacking objects) can attach themselves to verbs, as in some of the 
favorite phrases of gurus and geeks. Timothy Leary's indelible &quot;Turn on, tune 
in, drop out&quot; used such prepositions (often called particles). The prophets of 
high tech tune in to particles, too: boot up, dial in, log on.<br>
<br>
No one, though, knows prepositional ins and outs like poet and professor Morris 
Bishop, who wrote a ditty in 1947 called &quot;The Naughty Preposition&quot;:<br>
<br>
I lately lost a preposition;<br>
<br>
It hid, I thought, beneath my chair<br>
<br>
And angrily I cried &quot;Perdition!<br>
<br>
Up from out of in under there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Correctness is my vade mecum,<br>
<br>
And straggling phrases I abhor.<br>
<br>
And yet I wondered, &quot;What should he come<br>
<br>
Up from out of in under for?&quot;<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
A letter dated January 6, 1840, to eight-year-old Charles Dodgson (later known 
as Lewis Carroll) from his father might be called a lesson in writing with 
prepositions. It shows how prepositions were in the blood of the author who 
would start the title of his most famous book, Through the Looking-Glass, with 
one:<br>
<br>
My dearest Charles,<br>
<br>
…As soon as I get to Leeds I shall scream out in the middle of the street, 
Ironmongers, Ironmongers. Six hundred men will rush out of the street, in a 
moment— fly, fly in all directions— ring the bells, call the constables, set the 
Town on fire. I will have a file and a screw driver, and a ring, and if they are 
not brought directly, in forty seconds, I will leave nothing but one small cat 
alive in the whole town of Leeds, and I shall only leave that, because I am 
afraid I shall not have time to kill it. Then what a bawling and a tearing of 
hair there will be! Pigs and babies, camels and butterflies, rolling in the 
gutter together— old women rushing up the chimneys and cows after them— ducks 
hiding themselves in coffee-cups, and fat geese trying to squeeze themselves 
into pencil cases. At last the mayor of Leeds will be found in a soup plate 
covered up with custard, and stuck full of almonds to make him look like sponge 
cake that he may escape the dreadful destruction of the Town…. Then comes a man 
hid in a teapot crying and roaring, &quot;Oh, I have dropped my donkey. I put it up 
my nostril, and it has fallen out of the spout of the teapot into an old woman's 
thimble and she will squeeze it to death when she puts her thimble on….&quot;<br>
<br>
In the hands of Charles Dodgson, Sr., prepositions create mischief, what with 
cows rushing up chimneys and mayors in soupplates and men in teapots and donkeys 
in thimbles. Most writers, though, are content to use prepositions to ground 
their material, to tie nouns and pronouns logically to other parts of speech. In 
this regard, prepositions are indispensable. Look how a passage turns into a 
meaningless meteor shower without prepositions:<br>
<br>
The discoveries planets the solar system, stimulating renewed speculation other 
possible worlds throbbing life, are now drawing closer cosmic terms the world 
their discoverers.<br>
<br>
The latest detection, made this month American astronomers, is a planet twice 
the mass Jupiter that is orbiting the star Gliese 876, one the Sun's nearest 
neighbors….<br>
<br>
The discovery Gliese 876 adds another element surprise and surmise the 
continuing quest other planetary systems. The large object is orbiting a red 
dwarf star one-third the mass the Sun.<br>
<br>
Now look at the same passage as it was written for the New York Times by John 
Noble Wilford:<br>
<br>
The discoveries of planets beyond the solar system, stimulating renewed 
speculation of other possible worlds throbbing with life, are now drawing closer 
in cosmic terms to the world of their discoverers.<br>
<br>
The latest detection, made this month by American astronomers, is of a planet 
about twice the mass of Jupiter that is orbiting the star Gliese 876, one of the 
Sun's nearest neighbors….<br>
<br>
The discovery at Gliese 876 adds another element of surprise and surmise to the 
continuing quest for other planetary systems. The large object is orbiting a red 
dwarf star less than one-third the mass of the Sun.<br>
<br>
Prepositional phrases in prose can be grounding, but they can also make passages 
soar— especially when they are used discriminately and groomed carefully. Ideas 
expressed through prepositional phrases must be carefully crafted into parallel 
pieces, as in this clause from the Bible: &quot;Though I speak with the tongues of 
men and of angels.&quot; Those two prepositional phrases (of men and of angels) are 
nice and symmetrical, adding rhythmic value to the sentence.<br>
<br>
Parallelism is especially important in lists, where the use of prepositions can 
get dicey (but not impossibly difficult). In a New Yorker profile of Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, Joan Acocella is able to get away with this complex sentence only 
because she carefully tracks her prepositions:<br>
<br>
But what has made him an artist, and a popular artist, is the completeness of 
his performances: the level of concentration, the fullness of ambition, the 
sheer amount of detail, with the cast of the shoulder, the angle of the jaw, 
even the play of the fingers, all deployed in the service of a single, pressing 
act of imagination.<br>
<br>
Acocella's complicated sentence contains two embedded sets of prepositional 
phrases. But the parallel structure of their elements (in the first list, the + 
noun + of + noun; in the second, the + noun + of the + noun) keeps everything 
straight and allows Acocella one more string of prepositional phrases: &quot;in the 
service of a single, pressing act of imagination.&quot;<br>
<br>
The speeches of President John F. Kennedy are also models of prepositional 
propriety. Notice the parallelism in this fragment from his 1961 inaugural 
address:<br>
<br>
The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, born in this 
century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our 
ancient heritage.<br>
<br>
Each phrase contains one adjective followed by one prepositional phrase. The 
syntactic symmetry, the even cadence, is part of what makes the sentence 
memorable.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
Rid your prose of prepositional phrases whenever you can. Lodge your ideas 
directly in nouns and verbs. The mushiest abstractions and the greatest 
circumlocutions tend to be expressed as prepositional phrases (or pileups of 
them).<br>
<br>
CLEAR THE CLUTTER.<br>
<br>
The most frequent prepositional sin is to replace one good, terse word with a 
stack of prepositional phrases. The worst prepositional train wrecks crop up in 
legal writing, with its hereinbelows, with respect theretos, and thereins. But 
lawyers are hardly the only offenders. Have you ever counted the number of ways 
windy writers and speakers avoid the direct adverb now:<br>
<br>
as of now<br>
<br>
at present<br>
<br>
at this point in time<br>
<br>
at this time<br>
<br>
for the time being<br>
<br>
in this day and age<br>
<br>
in the not-too-distant future<br>
<br>
Of course, none of these beats Alexander Haig's all-time worst way not to say 
now: &quot;at this juncture of maturization.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anytime you can replace a cluster of words with one elegant one, do it. Use 
before instead of &quot;prior to&quot; or &quot;in advance of.&quot; Use because of instead of &quot;due 
to the fact that&quot; or &quot;in light of the fact that.&quot; Use imagination rather than 
&quot;the eye of the mind&quot; and my thinking instead of &quot;I'm inclining in the direction 
of.&quot; Scour your writing for prepositional barnacles worthy only of being scraped 
away, and replace them with simpler words:<br>
<br>
in regard to &#65532; about<br>
<br>
with reference to &#65532; about<br>
<br>
the approximate amount of &#65532; about<br>
<br>
in the interest of &#65532; for<br>
<br>
for the purpose of &#65532; for<br>
<br>
in order to &#65532; to<br>
<br>
in the event that &#65532; if<br>
<br>
a lot of &#65532; many<br>
<br>
a great number of &#65532; many<br>
<br>
the reason is because &#65532; because<br>
<br>
according as to whether &#65532; whether<br>
<br>
neat in appearance &#65532; neat<br>
<br>
Many setups can be replaced by a simpler, shorter word: &quot;He was conveyed to his 
place of residence in an intoxicated condition&quot; is itself reeling with 
prepositions; &quot;He was carried home drunk&quot; is better.<br>
<br>
Let's see what happens when we lop off a preposition altogether. This headline— 
&quot;Ferraro's Status as Favored Candidate Is Seen as Jeopardized&quot;— could have been 
expressed more clearly through nouns and verbs: &quot;Favored Candidate Ferraro Risks 
Becoming Favorite Has-Been.&quot; A common culprit is as, which was excised easily 
from that headline, and is equally cuttable in this sentence: &quot;Now that Apple's 
back on track, how long will Steven Jobs remain as CEO?&quot; Don't go &quot;visit with 
chums,&quot; just &quot;visit them.&quot; Why say &quot;I'll meet up with Fabio&quot; when &quot;I'll see 
Fabio&quot; is just as exciting?<br>
<br>
Beware the parasitic of, which sucks blood from the following phrases:<br>
<br>
How big of a deal was her departure?<br>
<br>
She wasn't that good of an editor.<br>
<br>
He gave all of his property.<br>
<br>
Outside of the office, he was a real card.<br>
<br>
Get down off of that table if you expect me to come home with you.<br>
<br>
&quot;OUT&quot; ALL VERBS.<br>
<br>
Some prepositional phrases are more dungeons than closets; trapped within are 
much worthier verbs, yearning to burst out. In David Copperfield, Mr. Micawber 
corrects his own circumlocution by replacing a prepositional phrase with a 
simple verb: &quot;It is not an avocation of a remunerative description— in other 
words, it does not pay.&quot; Unfortunately, not all characters are so astute. Follow 
the lead of Charles Dickens— get the action front and center:<br>
<br>
to be of the opinion that &#65532; to believe<br>
<br>
to be indicative of &#65532; to indicate<br>
<br>
to put in an appearance &#65532; to appear<br>
<br>
to take into consideration &#65532; to consider<br>
<br>
to raise some doubts about &#65532; to question<br>
<br>
to be in possession of &#65532; to own<br>
<br>
to set out certain of its characteristics &#65532; to expose<br>
<br>
for the purpose of providing &#65532; to provide<br>
<br>
to perform an analysis of &#65532; to analyze<br>
<br>
to study in depth &#65532; to examine<br>
<br>
Lame prepositional phrases can even drain a strong verb of its energy. In &quot;her 
dark Dominican eyes brighten with excitement,&quot; excise with excitement for a more 
vivid description of those wondrous eyes.<br>
<br>
PREPOSITIONING SUSPECTS.<br>
<br>
Professional obfuscators tend to rely on prepositions to spin out sentences no 
one can follow or hold them accountable for. But— really— is Linda Tripp's 
attorney, Anthony Zaccagnini, proud of this response to questions about his 
client's arrest as a nineteen-year-old:<br>
<br>
Due to the continuing investigation into the unauthorized release of information 
related to matters now under investigation, what can be said has been said.<br>
<br>
It's bad enough that Zaccagnini doubled over in the passive voice (&quot;what can be 
said has been said&quot;); see how those prepositional phrases make his answer even 
more wishy-washy? (He could have said, &quot;The continuing investigation of leaks 
prevents our saying more.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, on NBC's Meet the Press, got lost in 
prepositional hell when discussing another corner of the vast 
Clinton-Whitewater-Filegate-Lewinsky scandal:<br>
<br>
I don't think the First Lady's going to be indicted, no matter how much her 
fingerprints are on almost everything from Whitewater up to now in the eyes of 
many who are looking at this objectively.<br>
<br>
Backbenching the prepositions would make Hatch's point clearer: &quot;Any objective 
observer can see that the First Lady's fingerprints are on almost every White 
House screwup since Whitewater. But I doubt she'll be indicted.&quot;<br>
<br>
PREPOSITIONS ARE NOT VERBS.<br>
<br>
The best headline writers create the journalistic equivalent of haiku— fitting 
words into tight spaces, breaking their lines just right, and conveying the gist 
of an entire story in few picas. But boner headlines result when copy editors 
forget that the best way to state an idea is with a strong subject and a 
dramatic verb. When they &quot;save space&quot; by relying on teeny prepositions, the 
ideas shrink to nothingness.<br>
<br>
Take this headline that ran in the New York Times:<br>
<br>
Killer to Die for Sole Murder<br>
<br>
Of His 10 That Is in Doubt<br>
<br>
What's with that headline? Did someone hack up a fish? Rewrite the thing. Since 
it's a headline, you have to keep within the same amount of space, which is 
possible with an active verb and fewer prepositional phrases:<br>
<br>
Texas Killer's Execution Hinges<br>
<br>
On His One Unproven Crime<br>
<br>
Not only is the new headline clearer, but it adds a bit of information and 
avoids the horrible phrase &quot;That is in doubt,&quot; which, though technically 
correct, is downright dyspeptic.<br>
<br>
Sometimes prepositions are called upon to do the work of verbs, as in &quot;he's into 
hula.&quot; Don't hijack a preposition when a verb would do it better: &quot;He dances the 
hula every day in the grocery store checkout line.&quot;<br>
<br>
OBJECTION!<br>
<br>
The most common prepositional error is forgetting that the noun in a 
prepositional phrase is the object of the preposition. Remember, pronouns have a 
subjective and an objective case. The object of the preposition must be 
expressed in the objective case. During Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation 
hearings, Senator Hank Brown goofed in saying &quot;most members are like I.&quot; &quot;Like 
me&quot; would have been more judicious. (Hank, would you say &quot;to they&quot; or &quot;behind 
she&quot;?) The errors here come mostly when a pair of pronouns follows a 
preposition:<br>
<br>
Not &quot;just between you and I&quot; &#65532; just between you and me<br>
<br>
Not &quot;if it's up to Jan and I&quot; &#65532; if it's up to Jan and me<br>
<br>
Not &quot;the rich are different from you and I&quot; &#65532; the rich are different from you 
and me<br>
<br>
A footnote on that last example: Did you know that F. Scott Fitzgerald got his 
grammar right in the 1926 story, &quot;All the Sad Young Men&quot;? (&quot;Let me tell you 
about the very rich. They are different from you and me.&quot;) No longer can you 
misquote him in defense of bonehead grammar!<br>
<br>
THE LAST WORD ON PREPOSITIONS.<br>
<br>
Can we bury the schoolmarm's rule, &quot;Never end a sentence with a preposition,&quot; 
once and for all?<br>
<br>
Preposition, remember, means &quot;to stand before,&quot; and, yes, prepositions generally 
stand before the nouns they govern (their objects). Since we hate to force 
prepositions apart from their objects, the most graceful sentences don't end 
with prepositions. But prepositions and their objects should not be unnaturally 
forced together, either. Winston Churchill made fun of pedants who refuse to 
allow terminal prepositions. &quot;This is the sort of English up with which I will 
not put,&quot; Winston is said to have written in the margins of a report after a 
civil servant had convoluted a sentence so as not to end it with a preposition.<br>
<br>
When prepositions and verbs are joined at the hip, it is folly to separate them. 
In &quot;Use *eggnog* as a password when you want to log in,&quot; you simply must end on 
the preposition in.<br>
<br>
Whatever you do, don't try to have it both ways. One neurologist interviewed on 
TV decided to cover his bets, using his preposition twice: &quot;the HMOs to which 
they go to.&quot; Similarly, a lawyer at a technology conference in Minneapolis 
warned an audience nervous about using credit cards on the Internet: &quot;You have 
to have a reasonable comfort level with whom you're working with.&quot; That's one 
lawyer who needs a reasonable comfort level with prepositions. A San Francisco 
judge refused to give one convict probation, arguing &quot;It's not the type of crime 
of which you get a second chance with.&quot; That judge doesn't deserve probation, 
either.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Online denizens, masters of economy in phrasing (i.e., easy typing), grasped 
early on that prepositions are a drag. Starting with the belletrists at The 
Well, keyboard caperers developed a host of initialisms to cut prepositional 
phrases down to size: BTW replaces by the way, IMHO replaces in my humble 
opinion, IRL replaces in real life, and OTOH replaces on the other hand.<br>
<br>
People who speak pidgin English often do away with prepositions altogether, 
preferring to take the most direct tack possible. In Sierra Leone, wait for 
water small small means &quot;wait for the water for a little while&quot;; a preposition 
is also pared in all dem plenty (&quot;plenty of them&quot;). Go to Hawaii and listen to 
the island creole, and you'll hear blunt sentences like &quot;He go school,&quot; &quot;She 
make plenty money,&quot; and &quot;Try look da sunset&quot; (in place of &quot;Take a look at the 
sunset&quot;).<br>
<br>
While some choose to drop prepositions, certain writers embrace evocative ones 
that stretch the grammatical frontier. Steve Simpson at Goodby, Silverstein &amp; 
Partners created an ad for Norwegian Cruise Line that amounted to one long riff 
on a preposition. Here, beyond transcends its syntactic identity, becoming not 
just a preposition, a doorway, a means to an end, but the end itself.<br>

<br>
Conjunctions<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
In our grammatical house, conjunctions are the archways between adjoining rooms, 
the hallways connecting bedrooms, the staircases leading from floor to floor. 
Conjunctions, whose name comes from the Latin for &quot;join with,&quot; connect words, 
phrases, and clauses.<br>
<br>
Bob Dorough, the Schoolhouse Rocker who unleashed &quot;Conjunction Junction&quot; on kids 
in 1973, settled on the perfect title for his mnemonic number, since 
conjunctions place themselves at critical junctions in a sentence, where they 
connect words and link ideas (by &quot;hookin' up words and phrases and clauses&quot;).<br>
<br>
Different kinds of conjunctions join things in different ways:<br>
<br>
• Coordinate conjunctions, or the FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So), 
coordinate words, phrases, and clauses of equivalent value. A coordinate 
conjunction might hold together grammatically parallel words (naughty but nice) 
or parts of a list (X, Y, and Z). It might also conjoin two phrases playing 
parallel roles in a sentence (&quot;I'm so broke, I'll have a garage sale and hawk 
all my heirlooms&quot;), or keep distinct thoughts from drifting too far apart (&quot;I'll 
have the sale soon so I won't get too desperate&quot;).<br>
<br>
• Correlative conjunctions (both… and, either… or, if… then, neither… nor, and 
not only… but also) create equilibrium too between 
separate-though-grammatically-equal elements, but they operate differently: they 
come in pairs, and are separated by the words they bring into relation (&quot;If you 
buy my stuff, I'm neither bound to give change nor able to demand it&quot;).<br>
<br>
• Subordinate conjunctions attach themselves to the beginning of a full-blown 
clause (a string of words that could stand alone as a sentence) and, by doing 
so, make that clause dependent on another clause. For example, the clause &quot;I 
hear snap, crackle, and pop&quot; can stand on its own. But when you add until that 
clause must now attach itself to another independent clause to make sense: 
&quot;Until I hear snap, crackle, and pop, my tears will not stop.&quot; Subordinate 
conjunctions— after, although, as, as if, as long as, as though, because, 
before, even though, if, in order that, once, since, so that, though, unless, 
until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether, while— can come at the 
beginning of a sentence or smack dab in the middle.<br>
<br>
Now we must again pause to pay respects to those strange hybrids, the 
conjunctive adverbs— accordingly, afterwards, also, besides, consequently, 
earlier, finally, first, for example, furthermore, hence, however, indeed, 
instead, later, likewise, moreover, nevertheless, nonetheless, on the other 
hand, otherwise, second, similarly, still, then, therefore, thus.<br>
<br>
Conjunctive adverbs have two major roles. First, they help to juxtapose fully 
formed ideas, linking muscular independent clauses that could just as easily 
stand alone: &quot;I think; therefore, I am.&quot; Second, they act as &quot;transitional 
expressions,&quot; momentary bits of commentary that break into the flow of the 
clause, surrounded by commas: &quot;Quoting Descartes is cool. Subverting him, 
however, is better. Just ask Apple. (I think, therefore iMac.).&quot;<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
In and of themselves, conjunctions offer little in the way of literary flash, 
but they help to smooth prose, link ideas, and telegraph contradiction. 
Coordinate conjunctions put ideas in relation to each other: and likens them, or 
separates them, and yet throws them into opposition.<br>
<br>
In Green Hills of Africa, Ernest Hemingway describes reading a passage of 
Tolstoy's Sevastopol and being thrown into a reverie about the Boulevard 
Sébastopol in Paris. His use of and turns his sentence into a dreamlike 
description:<br>
<br>
Riding a bicycle down it in the rain on the way home from Strassburg and the 
slipperiness of the rails of the tram cars and the feeling of riding on greasy, 
slippery asphalt and cobble stones in traffic in the rain, and how we had nearly 
lived on the Boulevard du Temple that time, and I remembered the look of that 
apartment, how it was arranged, and the wall paper, and instead we had taken the 
upstairs of the pavilion in Notre Dame des Champs in the courtyard with the 
sawmill (and the sudden whine of the saw, the smell of sawdust and the chestnut 
tree over the roof with a mad woman downstairs), and the year worrying about 
money (all of the stories back in the post that came in through a slit in the 
saw-mill door, with notes of rejection that would never call them stories, but 
always anecdotes, sketches, contes, etc. They did not want them, and we lived on 
poireaux and drank cahors and water), and how fine the fountains were at the 
Place de L'Observatoire….<br>
<br>
In the hands of Hemingway, deceptively simple conjunctions give a passage at 
once an almost liturgical cadence and a very-twentieth-century 
stream-of-consciousness aspect.<br>
<br>
Correlative conjunctions, too, can bring ideas into a fluid stream, as in this 
sentence from the Bible, using neither… nor: &quot;Neither death, nor life, nor 
angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from 
the love of God.&quot;<br>
<br>
When it comes to building texture and complexity into writing, though, nothing 
beats subordinate conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs. They set up 
contradiction— and paradox is, after all, the root of everything deep. They take 
fully formed, well-spun ideas and make them into macramé.<br>
<br>
The opening passage of I Corinthians, 13 (this version is from the 1961 New 
English Bible), uses a series of echoing subordinate clauses to prove that of 
the three things &quot;that last for ever&quot;— faith, hope, and love— &quot;the greatest of 
them is love&quot;:<br>
<br>
I may speak in tongues of men or of angels, but if I am without love, I am a 
sounding gong or a clanging cymbal. I may have the gift of prophecy, and know 
every hidden truth; I may have faith strong enough to move mountains; but if I 
have no love, I am nothing. I may dole out all I possess, or even give my body 
to be burnt, but if I have no love, I am none the better.<br>
<br>
The Brothers Gibb, too, used subordinate conjunctions when they riffed on love: 
&quot;If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby/If I can't have you, ah, ah,/If I 
can't have you, I don't want nobody baby/If I can't have you, ah, ah.&quot;<br>
<br>
The most compelling arguments in academic writing are often expressed via a 
subordinate conjunction or a conjunctive adverb. In this effective thesis 
contrasting two Hemingway stories, &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot; 
and &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro,&quot; the writer telegraphs paradox through the 
subordinating conjunctions but and while: &quot;In both stories the hero confronts 
the African wild, Death, and his unhappy wife, but the two men respond 
oppositely: while Francis struggles to live, Harry struggles to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
The least inspired writers just spit out straightforward sentences without any 
effort to link ideas and frame the prose; they produce stories that may be 
precise but lack panache. Great writers, though, find the contradictions in 
their stories, and then frame them with transitional words. Francis X. Clines, 
of the New York Times, uses subordinate conjunctions to craft leads like this:<br>
<br>
After a harrowing week in which President Clinton was sworn in as a defendant in 
one sex scandal, then dragged by the headlines into another, the American 
public, parsing his language as much as his rectitude, had to wonder about the 
truth, or at least the passing comfort of the half-truth.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
DICK AND JANE.<br>
<br>
The principal sins with conjunctions are sins of omission— pasting choppy pieces 
together without any artful seaming. Hacks unable to weave ideas with 
conjunctions end up sounding like they ought to go back to grade school.<br>
<br>
Speaking of going back to grade school, beware too many simple sentences in a 
row.<br>
<br>
&quot;See the toys,&quot; said Sally.<br>
<br>
&quot;Horses and cows and pigs!<br>
<br>
And a funny red duck!<br>
<br>
I want that funny red duck.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clearly, it's not enough to just plug in innocent coordinate conjunctions; ands 
and ors and fors can lead to Dick-and-Jane-and-Sally repetitiveness.<br>
<br>
Also, beware too many buts, yets, and howevers. A paragraph can only stand so 
many changes in tack. Keep your contradictions under control, lest your reader 
get dizzy: &quot;I want that funny red duck, but not if it comes at too high a price. 
However, if Mom and Dad would pay for it, I might change my mind. Yet, if Mom 
and Dad are willing to pay, do you think they might spring for a funny red 
truck, however different it is from a duck?&quot;<br>
<br>
LIKE YOU LIKE IT.<br>
<br>
Although each part of speech has a distinct function, and although putting the 
right parts in their right places always makes for more graceful writing and 
eloquent speech, some errors are so persistent that many grammarians just give 
up and go descriptive— that is, they stop prescribing &quot;correct&quot; usage and start 
&quot;describing&quot; common usage. The swapping of like, a preposition, for as or as if, 
both conjunctions, is one case that only the grittiest grammarians continue to 
oppose. Believe me, like wants to be followed by a good noun; like is longing to 
make a nice, tight prepositional phrase: He looks like Woody Allen. As is used 
correctly when it introduces a clause (a subject and a verb): Do as I say, not 
as I do.<br>
<br>
This is not rocket science. It's easy to rephrase a thought through either a 
subordinate clause or a prepositional phrase. So there's no reason to write &quot;You 
can learn this little lesson, like I have&quot; when these options are available: 
&quot;You can absorb this little lesson, as I have&quot; or &quot;Like me, you can learn this 
little lesson.&quot;<br>
<br>
But people still use like incorrectly all the time: &quot;Looks like he'll get the 
job, lucky sucker.&quot; Or &quot;She piled up her hair like she was Marie Antoinette.&quot; 
Even Graham Greene wrote about girls who &quot;change their lovers like they change 
their winter clothes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Greene's compatriot Evelyn Waugh once disparaged this use of like as 
&quot;proletarian grammar.&quot; If you wanna be a prole, go ahead, use like instead of 
as. But if you wanna be a pro, don't act as if you don't know what you're doing.<br>
<br>
DON'T BE TONE DEAF.<br>
<br>
Conjunctions, though seemingly inconspicuous, can greatly alter the tone of 
prose. An overabundance of ands can make prose so fluid it's downright goopy. On 
the other hand, too many semicolons in place of ands and fors can so ratchet up 
the tension that readers'll need a stiff drink to stay with you. Too many 
subordinate conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs can make prose more a chore 
than a pleasure. Keep in command of your tone.<br>
<br>
Words like plus can seem too breezy and informal; words like indeed can make you 
sound prissy and antiquarian. Unless you want to sound like a pontificating 
professor, stay away from moreover, nevertheless, and thus. I mean, nobody talks 
like that.<br>
<br>
MAKE MY DAY. START A SENTENCE WITH A CONJUNCTION.<br>
<br>
A-student types who memorized everything their English teachers said insist that 
coordinating conjunctions cannot begin sentences. If editors ever try to feed 
you such wrongheadedness, throw these gems their way: And God said, Let there be 
light; and there was light. (Courtesy, the Old Testament.) Man is the only 
animal that blushes. Or needs to. (Courtesy, Mark Twain.) And after all the 
weather was ideal. They could not have had a more perfect day for a garden-party 
if they had ordered it. (Courtesy, Katherine Mansfield).<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
The most memorable conjunction scandal happened in the early 1960s when R. J. 
Reynolds launched an ad campaign with this infamous tag line: &quot;Winston tastes 
good like a cigarette should.&quot;<br>
<br>
The grammar queens ignited. (And wouldn't you, too, now that you've learned the 
little lesson of like?) They were right: the lowly preposition like is just not 
up to the task of linking the two clauses &quot;Winston tastes good&quot; and &quot;a cigarette 
should&quot; (&quot;taste good&quot; is implied). What was needed, the pedants proclaimed, was 
the subordinate conjunction as. The tag should have read &quot;Winston tastes good as 
a cigarette should.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure, sure. A preposition is not a conjunction. But guess what? The sentence 
works. Winston, unbowed, came back with a follow-up series of ads asking, &quot;What 
do you want— good grammar or good taste?&quot; The exquisite choice is expressed by— 
what else?— the conjunction or.<br>

<br>
Interjections<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
To the house constructed of the parts of speech, we must finally add 
interjections— the banging windows and bursting pipes that add excitement to the 
story inside. Meaning something &quot;thrown between or among&quot; other things, an 
interjection is a cry, cluck, or sudden outburst: wow!, goddammit, oh, jeesh…, 
hey!, tsk! tsk! Whether single words or short phrases, interjections don't 
function structurally in sentences. But, boy, are they fun.<br>
<br>
You'll most likely find interjections at the beginning of a sentence, followed 
by a comma or an exclamation point: Ahem! Wake up— this is the last chapter on 
parts of speech. Typically, when an interjection pops up in the middle of a 
sentence, it is surrounded by commas: I am awake. You're telling me, alas, that 
this is the last word on Words?<br>
<br>
You have to look hard to find a philologist who takes this part of speech 
seriously, but here's what William Mathews, in Words: Their use and abuse, had 
to say back in 1876 about the interjection: &quot;It is heard wherever men 
interchange thought and feeling, whether on the gravest or the most trivial 
themes; in tones of the tenderest love and of the deadliest hate; in shouts of 
joy and ecstasies of rapture, and in the expression of deep anguish, remorse and 
despair; in short, in the outburst of every human feeling…. These little words, 
so expressive of joy, of hope, of doubt, of fear, which leap from the heart like 
fiery jets from volcanic isles,— these surviving particles of the ante-Babel 
tongues, which spring with the flush or blanching of the face to all lips, and 
are understood by all men,— these 'silver fragments of a broken voice'… are 
emphatically and preëminently language.&quot;<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
Interjections sit perhaps most naturally in writing such as Lewis Carroll's 
Jabberwocky— because they carry about as much weight as their nonsense 
neighbors:<br>
<br>
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
He went galumphing back.<br>
<br>
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
Oh frabjous day! Callooh, Callay!<br>
<br>
But interjections pop up in serious writing as well. One nineteenth-century 
critic claimed that the interjection indeed, in the following passage from 
Othello, contains &quot;the gist of the chief action of the play, and it implies all 
that the plot develops&quot;:<br>
<br>
IAGO:<br>
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.<br>
<br>
OTHELLO:<br>
O yes, and went between us very oft.<br>
<br>
IAGO:<br>
INDEED!<br>
<br>
OTHELLO:<br>
Indeed? ay. Indeed. discern'st thou aught in that? Is he not honest?<br>
<br>
IAGO:<br>
Honest, my lord?<br>
<br>
OTHELLO:<br>
Honest! ay, honest!<br>
<br>
In the dialogue of plays or novels, interjections convey colloquial verve, as in 
this example from Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie:<br>
<br>
Knowledge— Zzzzzp! Money— Zzzzzp! Power! that's the cycle democracy is built on!<br>
<br>
Zzzzzp is hardly Standard Written English, but it's the kind of word we throw 
into speech all the time. It fits perfectly in Williams's script.<br>
<br>
Since speech tics reveal as much individuality as proper syntax, interjections 
can help impart character. While editors and copy editors may strike any 
interjection they see, reporters who care about conveying the salt of the people 
they've interviewed should fight to keep them in. That's what David Kline did 
for his 1994 interview with John Malone, the head of cable TV giant TCI. Known 
as telecom's Darth Vader, the bad boy of the cable industry, Malone peppers his 
speech with expletives and earthy metaphors. Kline left his interjections in, as 
they reflected the personality of the &quot;Infobahn Warrior&quot;:<br>
<br>
Look, if you could really get the RBOCs to tell the truth, they'd tell you that 
the plain old telephone business is huge— I mean, look at their revenues— and 
that's what they're primarily going after. And the interactive video business is 
a lucky strike extra, OK? US West's attitude, when we started seeing the 
penetrations we were getting in the UK… I mean, they just said, &quot;Geez, if you 
project these numbers to the US— wow! This is a terrific business!&quot;<br>
<br>
Leaving in so many interjections is not typical in profiles of corporate CEOs. 
But then, Malone is no typical CEO.<br>
<br>
Finally, consider interjections in your own narratives. Injected— er, 
interjected— strategically, these clumps of consonants make phrasing less 
formal. Use 'em when you're ready to loosen the old rhetorical tie, when you 
want to sound like you, talking. In his facetious treatment of portals (those 
commercial Web sites that serve as gateways to the Internet), Wired's Randall 
Rothenberg throws in a few interjections to contribute a sense of off-the-cuff 
comedy:<br>
<br>
So, I've decided to become a portal.<br>
<br>
The reason is simple. My friends and family believe I've been drifting, resting 
on the boy-wonder thing long after both my hair and my career prospects have 
thinned. &quot;What are you up to?&quot; they ask, with obvious concern…. I can't tell 
them the truth: In my field, communications, everything reeks of familiarity. 
Newspapers, magazines, books? Been there. Speechwriting, annual reports, 
graffiti? Done that.<br>
<br>
But to be a portal! There's something to wake the senses. People love portals. 
On the Net, everybody's got to pass through them. Companies are desperate to 
associate with them. Wall Street is valuing them at something like 27 times 1999 
revenues— present earnings being a bit difficult to come by. At those ratios, I 
(who, like portals, also don't have much in the way of earnings) can go from 
making… well, very little, to a net worth of… boy, a whole lot.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
Some would argue that every interjection is a sin. &quot;Brutish and inarticulate,&quot; 
critics have called them. &quot;Beautiful and gaudy,&quot; say others, and &quot;the miserable 
refuge of the speechless.&quot; Interjections aren't evil, but it's good to watch for 
certain bad habits.<br>
<br>
NOW HEAR THIS.<br>
<br>
In fact-based journalism, copy editors often airbrush out all interjections. But 
listen to jittery broadcast reporters, and you'll hear them filling their patter 
with a relentless series of uhs and yeahs and wells. One TV reporter in the San 
Francisco Bay Area begins almost every sentence with the interjection now: &quot;Now, 
you may be wondering…. Now, officials say…. Now, the parade starts at….&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't let your writing be as thoughtless as breathless broadcast. Don't do 
impromptu prose. If you want to use interjections, don't merely repeat them ad 
infinitum. Make sure they add something.<br>
<br>
THERE WAS, LIKE, THIS INTERJECTION….<br>
<br>
As you know from reading chapter 7, the preposition like often gets hijacked and 
carried off into conjunctionland. Even worse, sometimes it gets enslaved as an 
interjection. In speech, like as an interjection buys you a little time when 
your mind can't keep up with your mouth. But in prose it has the effect of 
whittling your words down to whimpering, simpering sissyspeak.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Cobweblike<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Political impersonators hang entire caricatures of Ronald Reagan on the Great 
Communicator's predilection for the interjection Well—. Rich Little said a 
presidential aide's advice to start everything with Well gave him the hook he 
needed to mimic Reagan. Comedians couldn't get enough of Reagan's put-down of 
Jimmy Carter (&quot;Well, there you go again&quot;), and Saturday Night Live's Jim Morris 
was still doing the Reagan Well in 1998: &quot;Well, am I still president? No? Well, 
I'll have you know….&quot;<br>
<br>
Segueing from comedy to comics, we can find the true home of interjections. In 
comics, these &quot;throwaways&quot; hold their own against nouns and verbs and are styled 
bold for extra intonation and emphasis. Beetlejuice #1, by Harvey Comics, is 
packed with 'em:<br>
<br>
Smek!<br>
<br>
Thoom!<br>
<br>
Skathrak!<br>
<br>
Bwaaaah!<br>
<br>
Puff! Gasp! Wheeze!<br>
<br>
Thump! Thump! Thump!<br>
<br>
Eeyew! Glub! Gasp!<br>
<br>
Umm… Thank you!<br>
<br>
Gaaah!<br>
<br>
The comic book Hate, drawn by Peter Bagge and Jim Blanchard, gives us slacker 
twentysomethings in all their rhetorical glory. As two characters, Buddy and 
Sherrill, go on a date at an Italian restaurant, the balloons hovering above 
their heads deliver Sherrill's interjection-studded style, with &quot;Ya,&quot; &quot;uh,&quot; 
&quot;&nbsp;'cuz,&quot; &quot;eww,&quot; &quot;ugh,&quot; and &quot;ya know.&quot; The look on Buddy's face betrays his 
feigned interest in his date's conversation; his reply is understated (&quot;hmmm…&quot;). 
Until, that is, Sherrill invites him home. Buddy out loud utters &quot;Errr… sure! 
That sounds good…,&quot; but, oh, the interjections bubbling in his head: &quot;Oh Boy! Oh 
Boy!&quot;<br>
<br>
Some interjections— &quot;?!?,&quot; for example, or &quot;#@%*!&quot;— go completely off the deep 
end. Leaving letters in the dust, they let us depart the world of words 
altogether.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;CHAPTER 9&#65532;<br>
<br>
The Subject, the Predicate<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
&quot;I came. I saw. I conquered.&quot; In each sentencette, Julius Caesar showed unity of 
thought and expressed himself in the most direct way possible. Like Caesar, you 
should put your faith in the sentence's bare bones: subject and predicate.<br>
<br>
The subject of a sentence is who or what the thing is about. In Caesar's 
statements, the subject is the pronoun I. In other sentences, the subject might 
be a noun (&quot;The masseuse makes me melt&quot;) or a noun phrase (&quot;Anyone with the 
Shiatsu touch makes me melt&quot;).<br>
<br>
The predicate, at its core, is a verb that tells what the subject does or is. In 
Caesar's statements, the predicates are the single verbs came, saw, and 
conquered. In our sentences, the predicate is the entire statement about the 
subjects: makes me melt. The predicate, in short, is everything that is not the 
subject. In addition to the verb, it can contain direct objects, indirect 
objects, and various kinds of phrases— all of which we'll come to in later 
chapters.<br>
<br>
&quot;The verb is the heartthrob of a sentence,&quot; writes Karen Elizabeth Gordon in The 
Transitive Vampire. &quot;Without a verb, a group of words can never hope to be 
anything more than a fragment, a hopelessly incomplete sentence, a eunuch or 
dummy of a grammatical expression.&quot;<br>
<br>
Indeed, no sentence is complete until you know what the subject did. The verb 
must be explicit, although the subject can be implied, almost embedded in the 
verb. One of the strongest opening lines in American literature— &quot;Call me 
Ishmael&quot;— seems to possess no subject. But Herman Melville merely exploits the 
imperative voice, in which the subject— you— is implied.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Readme.<br>
<br>
A sentence must have a subject and a predicate, but it can have more than one of 
each. In a sentence with a compound subject, nouns gang up on a verb: &quot;The 
Easter Bunny and his personal assistant put the eggs in a basket.&quot; In a compound 
predicate a subject does more than one thing: &quot;Put all your eggs in one basket 
and— WATCH THAT BASKET.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER how to diagram a sentence? I know, I know, memories of 
grammar school make you groan, but diagramming sentences really puts things into 
perspective. Why? Because diagramming casts the sentence as a stream, as a 
straight line, with a start (the subject) and a finish (the predicate):<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
Caesar's &quot;I came,&quot; for example, would be diagrammed:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
Diagramming shows that every sentence, no matter how complicated, derives 
energy, clear direction, and momentum from the subject and the predicate.<br>
<br>
Here's the diagram of a less simple sentence— &quot;The waterway flowed sombre under 
an overcast sky&quot;— which is a fragment from the opening of Heart of Darkness:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
Diagramming sentences also exposes a brutal truth about pileups of modifiers and 
phrases: they do not advance the message; they dangle off the hull of a sentence 
like tow lines. The more a sentence drags extraneous words and phrases, the more 
it slows from schooner to barge.<br>
<br>
Here's a less elegant sentence, courtesy of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, 
which invites authors to craft the opening sentence to the worst of all possible 
novels: &quot;Like an overripe beefsteak tomato rimmed with cottage cheese, the 
corpulent remains of Santa Claus lay dead on the hotel floor.&quot; The sentence 
diagram shows why that sentence is such a brilliant boner:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
As you can see, the stuff of this sentence does not follow the throughline, but 
rather drags it down.<br>
<br>

To tell a story in few words, think strong subject, strong predicate. No one 
knows this better than the headline writers of the world, who, when they pull it 
out, manage to convey the news and the blues with a minimum of words and a 
maximum of wit.<br>
<br>
The winner in the subject-predicate category would have to be this headline from 
the New York Post, announcing that Elizabeth Taylor tied the knot in 1991 for 
the eighth (count 'em) time:<br>
<br>
I do… I do… I do… I do… I do, I do… I do… I DO!<br>
<br>
(That double &quot;I do, I do&quot; in the middle stands for the two separate weddings of 
Liz and Richard Burton.)<br>
<br>
Like headline writers, the best reporters stand back, squint like painters 
taking in landscapes, and sketch out the bold outlines of their stories through 
strong subjects and predicates. Their stories distill the drama into a few 
select sentences.<br>
<br>
The classic news lead is Subject-Predicate City, collapsing a story into a 
thirty-five-words-or-fewer sentence that tells Who, What, When, Where, and maybe 
even Why. When an American caused a royal stir in London, Jason Bennetto, of the 
London Independent, nailed all five Ws in the opening of his story:<br>
<br>
Buckingham Palace came under aerial assault Saturday for the first time since 
World War II, when a half-naked American paraglider landed on the roof.<br>
<br>
In case you missed 'em all, here are the five Ws: Who— a half-naked American. 
What— landed on the palace roof. When— Saturday. Where— er, London. Why— Don't 
you want to read on to find out?<br>
<br>
Even when reporters at the best metropolitan dailies defy the five-W formula 
with abandon, they hardly abandon simple subjects and predicates. Take Beth 
Hughes's opener for a story on the California tofu business that ran in the San 
Francisco Examiner:<br>
<br>
It's white. It's weird. It wiggles on a plate.<br>
<br>
DIRECT, DECLARATIVE SENTENCES are also staples of the staccato dialogues of 
David Mamet. With an infallible ear for the rhythms of American speech, Mamet 
puts the basic sentence on display in his plays and in prose like this snippet 
from Make-Believe Town:<br>
<br>
For years I played cards every day. The game was held in an old junk store on 
the North Side of Chicago. The junk store was a front for a fence, and the fence 
ran a game every day of the year from noon till eight P.M., and I was there 
every day.<br>
<br>
One morning, before the game, I'd gone downtown on some errand, and thought to 
stop in and visit my dad and say hello. We drank coffee in his office. As noon 
approached, I said I had to go. He asked where I was going. &quot;Poker,&quot; I said. 
&quot;You still using cards?&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Now, at the time, and for some time thereafter, I found his remark recherché, 
quite overmuch the comment a wise, tough man— and he was both— would enjoy 
making to his son. &quot;Are you still using cards?&quot; That is, &quot;Do you still require 
the artificial constrictions of a self-delimiting game? Do you still need a 
circumscribed arena, and can you not see that the Game goes on around you all 
the time?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mamet's subjects and predicates have oomph. His crisp sentences are deliberate. 
The parody of what his father might have said (&quot;Do you still require the 
artificial constrictions…&quot;) reveals how thoroughly Mamet appreciates the wise 
and tough stuff of simple sentences like &quot;Are you still using cards?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whether you write short, punchy sentences or long, flowing ones, keeping track 
of your subjects and predicates can prevent your prose from shifting and 
drifting.<br>
<br>
Memorable stories are a collection of taut sentences whose focus never wanders. 
In a New Yorker profile of North Carolina IRS agent Garland Bunting, Alec 
Wilkinson tracks his subject without ever losing him. Almost every sentence 
features as its subject Garland, Garland Bunting, or he:<br>
<br>
For more than thirty years, Garland Bunting has been engaged in capturing and 
prosecuting men and women in North Carolina who make and sell liquor illegally. 
To do this, he has driven taxis, delivered sermons, peddled fish, buckdanced, 
worked carnivals as a barker, operated bulldozers, loaded carriages and hauled 
logs at sawmills, feigned drunkenness, and pretended to be an idiot. In the mind 
of many people, he is the most successful revenue agent in the history of a 
state that has always been enormously productive of moonshine.<br>
<br>
Garland is fifty-nine. He is of medium height and portly. He has a small mouth, 
thin lips, a nose that is slightly hooked, and eyes that are clear and close-set 
and steel blue. What hair he has is bristly and gray. A billed cap bearing the 
emblem of a fertilizer company or a trucking concern or an outfit that makes 
farm equipment customarily adorns his head. He has a splayfooted walk and a 
paunch like a feed sack. He possesses what he calls &quot;that sweet-potato shape— 
small at both ends and big in the middle,&quot; and he says, &quot;It's hard to keep pants 
up on a thing like that.&quot; A few years ago, he walked into a clothing store to 
buy a suit, spread his jacket wide for a salesman, and said, &quot;I'd like to see 
something to fit this,&quot; and the salesman said, &quot;I would, too.&quot;<br>
<br>
To trail a man by car, Garland will sometimes wear a disguise— usually a 
mustache or a woman's blond wig. Truck drivers occasionally flirt with their 
horns at the sight of him wearing his wig. &quot;I put on my wig and some glasses,&quot; 
he says, &quot;and those drivers think I'm Sweet Mama Tree-Top Tall.&quot;<br>
<br>
In only a couple of sentences of those first fifteen does Wilkinson let his 
subject stray: &quot;A billed cap… customarily adorns his head&quot; and &quot;Truck drivers 
occasionally flirt….&quot; What's more, Wilkinson is disciplined and avoids the 
classic cliché of the novice narrative writer, gunking up the profile with 
sentences like &quot;I met Garland Bunting on my first day in North Carolina….&quot; 
Instead, Wilkinson lets his presence recede, throwing Garland Bunting into 
relief.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
Remember, every sentence is a mini-narrative. Stop for a second and think before 
you write. What is your subject? Does every sentence pertain to your subject? 
Can you reframe sentences so they don't wander off on tangents? Here are some 
sins to watch out for:<br>
<br>
LOTSA PAP, LITTLE PITH.<br>
<br>
Subjects and predicates— especially if they're not strong— can get lost in a 
mass of fluffy words. This line from a Times of London editorial on July 25, 
1815, announced that the defeated Napoleon had arrived in England— well, sort 
of: &quot;He is, therefore, what we may call, here.&quot; That sentence, in all its 
softness, equivocation, and absence of action, worked to describe a broken and 
imprisoned ex-emperor. But that doesn't mean you should wimp out on subjects and 
predicates in our un-Napoleonic times.<br>
<br>
Mushy-mouthedness can come from a refusal to commit. Attorney General Elliot 
Richardson once said, &quot;And yet, on balance, affirmative action has, I think, 
been a qualified success.&quot; Why couldn't the man dig his subject and predicate 
out of that rubble and say &quot;Affirmative action usually works&quot;?<br>
<br>
MISSING IN ACTION.<br>
<br>
Sentence fragments may start with a capital letter and end with a period, but 
these globs of words lack either a subject or, more often, a verb. They are 
shards of thought, shadows of ideas, shams in the prose department. Granted, 
every now and then sentence fragments work rhetorically. (We'll get to those 
gems later.) But fragments usually make prose halting and choppy, and come off 
as phony— gratuitous attempts at edgy informality.<br>
<br>
A letter offering a credit card from Chase Manhattan Bank starts off with a bona 
fide sentence, but then veers into bonehead fragments:<br>
<br>
As someone with a good credit history, you know the importance of having a 
flexible financial tool. One that enables you to pay for all your major 
expenses, yet still allows you to make low monthly payments. A credit option 
that gives you greater cash flow, without stretching the limits of your credit 
cards or using your home as collateral. A flexible tool like Chase Advantage 
Credit ®. It's the line of credit you access simply by writing a check.<br>
<br>
Despite the periods, none of the underlined statements is a complete sentence 
(&quot;that&quot; makes two of them dependent clauses). That last line qualifies as a 
sentence, but— really— access as a verb?<br>
<br>
It's one thing to see fragments in the compressed lines of advertising copy. But 
when magazine editors start using the gimmick, they should go back to J-school. 
The headline above the editor's note in the début issue of Business 2.0 promised 
&quot;Not Business as Usual.&quot; Did the editor really mean he was planning to forsake 
the good old sentence?<br>
<br>
Some magazines are for coffee tables. Others for the trash. Business 2.0 targets 
a nobler destination: your mind. Because everything that was comfortable and 
familiar about business is changing.<br>
<br>
We're at the beginning of an age that will see the relentless act of connecting 
everything to everything else. This networked economy— decentralized and 
antihierarchical— will be the most important force shaping the next decade….<br>
<br>
The brightest minds of our day are working hard on these issues, and that's 
where we join in. We'll explore the people, companies, and ideas that are making 
the New Economy happen. Figure out what makes them tick. Discover their flaws. 
Illuminate their victories.<br>
<br>
A magazine that sends subjects and verbs to the trash is sure to end up there 
itself. Remember: sentence fragments are not fully fleshed thoughts. Use them at 
your peril.<br>
<br>
DON'T TRY YOUR READER's PATIENCE.<br>
<br>
If subjects and predicates drift too far apart in sentences, separated by 
endless intervening clauses, the reader may give up. The second sentence in this 
paragraph from the San Francisco Chronicle needed a copy editor:<br>
<br>
The baby was delivered Tuesday by Caesarean section. With the approval of the 
infant's family, the respirator that had kept the mother's heart and lungs 
functioning for 64 days so the baby could live in her womb was turned off.<br>
<br>
Here's how that sentence might have been tamed:<br>
<br>
The baby was delivered Tuesday by Caesarean section. With the approval of the 
infant's family, the doctors then turned off the respirator that had kept the 
mother's heart and lungs functioning for 64 days so the baby could mature in her 
womb.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the opposite occurs: statements get so condensed, so squished 
together, that subjects and predicates become indistinguishable. Can you figure 
out what story this headline in the Toronto Star is trying to tell?<br>
<br>
Fire put woman in coma highrise inquest told<br>
<br>
Maybe some punctuation would have helped (&quot;Fire put woman in coma, highrise 
inquest told&quot;), but that headline writer was thinking comas, not commas.<br>
<br>
Richard Lederer, in Anguished English, has collected what he calls &quot;two-headed 
headlines,&quot; in which the blurring of subject and predicate makes for syntactical 
mayhem:<br>
<br>
WILLIAM KELLY, 87, WAS FED SECRETARY<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
THE SUBJECT-VERB TANGO.<br>
<br>
Some sentences do contain a clear subject and a clear predicate, but the poor 
things aren't dancing in unison. Just as pronouns must agree with their 
antecedents, verbs must agree with their subjects. A singular subject requires a 
singular verb; a plural subject requires— guess what?— a plural verb.<br>
<br>
Here's a description of a nineteenth-century lady whose subject and verb are 
improper, despite her very proper kid gloves:<br>
<br>
A horse car. Enter an elaborately dressed lady, diamond solitaires, eight-button 
kids, etc. Car crowded. At first no one moves. Soon a gentleman offers his seat. 
&quot;Thank you; you are the only gentleman here. The rest is hogs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since the &quot;lady&quot; is referring to all the other men on the car, her sentence 
should have been &quot;The rest are hogs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#65532;Get these or get thee to a mummery.<br>
<br>
FALSE STARTS.<br>
<br>
Beware of sentences that get off on the wrong foot by starting with &quot;I think,&quot; 
&quot;There was,&quot; or &quot;It is.&quot; Strike those beginnings and start right in with your 
true subject:<br>
<br>
I think that this book will set you straight.<br>
<br>
There are writers out there who are desperate for pithy advice.<br>
<br>
It is my opinion that everyone needs grammar.<br>
<br>
If you are a reporter taking care to get down, verbatim, everything a source 
says, you're on the right track. But you don't have to report every &quot;I think&quot; a 
subject utters. Make the cut in quotes like this:<br>
<br>
&quot;I think the biggest problem in American schools has been the search for one 
right way,&quot; says Chris Whittle, founder of the Edison Project.<br>
<br>
Part of rewriting and editing is taking the slack out of sentences, eliminating 
the false starts and fitfulnesses. Here, for example, is how Wired writer Po 
Bronson tightened a graf in a story on Silicon Valley headhunters:<br>
<br>
If I show up at 3Com with a knockout candidate, you think they're going to slam 
the door in my face? Every time a startup backs off from an IPO, there's 
disappointed employees there who will take my call. Every time a new manager 
takes over an ongoing project, there are employees who are supposed to work 
under him who won't get along with the new boss, and they'll take my call.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
In the hands of skillful writers, sentence fragments can perk up prose, making 
it less stiff and formal. They can also help punctuate long sentences. Call it 
pause and effect, the fragment brightening the narrative with a dash of 
staccato.<br>
<br>
In The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy uses sentence fragments, often to 
comic effect. In the following paragraphs, she mixes long and lyrical sentences 
with some pipsqueaks. In doing so, she adds punch to the pathos of a family's 
failed enterprises:<br>
<br>
From the dining-room window where she stood, with the wind in her hair, Rahel 
could see the rain drum down on the rusted tin roof of what used to be their 
grandmother's pickle factory.<br>
<br>
Paradise Pickles &amp; Preserves.<br>
<br>
It lay between the house and the river.<br>
<br>
They used to make pickles, squashes, jams, curry powders and canned pineapples. 
And banana jam (illegally) after the FPO (Food Products Organization) banned it 
because according to their specification it was neither jam nor jelly. Too thin 
for jelly and too thick for jam. An ambiguous, unclassifiable consistency, they 
said.<br>
<br>
As per their books.<br>
<br>
Sentence fragments can also be poetic. Heather Millar wrote a piece for Wired 
magazine about monks and nuns forgoing the traditional industries of 
brandy-making and fruitcake-baking in favor of typing digital documents and 
designing Web pages. To underscore the central theme, Millar used some 
strategically placed sentence fragments:<br>
<br>
Humble work lies at the center of the monastic vocation, but their choice of 
lifestyle doesn't mean that they are a different strain of humanity. Many 
monastics devote much time to the human condition: teaching and working in 
hospitals and homeless shelters. But isn't the decision to withdraw from the 
world that lies at the center of the monastic vocation at odds with working on 
the Internet, with its pockets of humanity at its wildest and woolliest?<br>
<br>
Negotiating a balance between separation and connection has always been one of 
the central challenges for monks and nuns. As the Rule of Life for the Monks of 
Jerusalem puts it, &quot;Give up theaters and cinemas once and for all. This is part 
of the necessary break. But be well-informed, open to others, attentive to the 
city's cries for help.&quot;<br>
<br>
Separation. Connection. Separation. Connection. These men and women are happy to 
walk the line.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
CARNAL PLEASURES ARE EVEN MORE common when we get out of the monastery. This 
headline from the New York Post proves you don't always need a subject and a 
verb to hook readers onto a story:<br>
<br>
Headless Body in Topless Bar<br>
<br>
The fragments known as email subject headers— the words you see when you check 
your daily torrent of messages— must do the same double duty as newspaper 
headlines. The good subject headers pack a terse sentence into the subject 
field, as in this one from an editor to her lover:<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: go ahead and call— coast is clear. m<br>
<br>
That got two sentences and a signature into a few bits.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, though, the subject and predicate are artfully embedded in a few 
keystrokes. In the following subject header, the mini-narrative lurks not in a 
subject and predicate but in the punctuation itself:<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: dinner?<br>
<br>
A one-word narrative. In the crook of the question mark is the crux of the 
sentence (&quot;Would you like to join me for…&quot;).<br>
<br>
Sometimes headers are flat-out teases, catching your interest by keeping the 
subject and predicate a mystery:<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: airsex<br>
<br>
Is airsex the subject? Is airsex the verb? You can bet a lot of Dilberts opened 
this email, which contained a news-wire story on &quot;a trend toward more brazen 
consensual sex&quot; on all commercial flights:<br>
<br>
Formerly rare seat and lavatory couplings are now reported as commonplace by 
flight crews worldwide. Flight attendant consultants' advice on how to deal with 
in-seat trysters: address passengers by name, crouch down to eye-to-eye level 
with them, and don't threaten.<br>
<br>
Whether or not they technically contain a subject and a predicate, the best 
headers convey everything a sentence conveys. Doesn't each of these headers make 
you want to open the email and hear the story?<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: i have just one word for you<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: my mother<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: Oh, Mexico…<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: woe<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: RSVP to Soiree 98 by 1/18!!<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: Part Two, Wherein Lies the Joke….<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: the official word<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: point blank pie<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: Prepare to Be Overwhelmed<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: last chance<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: SOS<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: writer threatening suicide<br>
<br>
&gt;Subject: peep<br>
<br>
That last one is enigmatic. Is peep the plaintive cry of someone badly in need 
of attention? Is it the promise of a risqué glimpse? Or is it an imperative 
(Look here or you will forever face regret….)? That peep works because it could 
be all three.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;&#65532; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Part 2<br>
<br>
Sentences<br>
A sentence brings words together into a stream of thought. It lets fragments 
flow together and become complete ideas. It has direction, a current, momentum.<br>
<br>
Much more than &quot;everything between the capital letter and the period,&quot; it tells 
who did what to whom. Consider the sentence a story, a mini-narrative, a yarn, 
with a beginning and an ending and a dramatic arc.<br>
<br>
These principles will help to give your sentences energy:<br>
<br>
RELISH EVERY WORD.<br>
<br>
Sentences should be as varied as our objects of desire— sometimes we want them 
brawny, sometimes we want them brainy, sometimes silken, sometimes brutal. We 
don't want them to stay the same, day after day.<br>
<br>
Yet we're so used to sound bites, to narrowcasting and net surfing, to teenagers 
bypassing whole paragraphs with &quot;duh&quot; or &quot;whatever,&quot; that we are tempted, in 
sentences, to the short and quick. But, remember, the imagination courses in 
unpredictable waves. As writers we must become intimate with the ferocity of 
simple sentences, as well as the gentle tumbling of phrases and clauses.<br>
<br>
BE SIMPLE, BUT GO DEEP.<br>
<br>
In high school, many of us were assigned term papers that seemed impossibly 
long. (How do I fill fifteen pages?!?) We learned to stretch them out, to write 
windy, to &quot;state, restate, and summarize.&quot; We must unlearn such tricks as we 
refine our writing skills. The best sentences are models of economy, getting to 
the point (well, the period) quickly. Sentences derive energy from strong 
structure and packed phrasing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mangia!&quot; cries the Italian mamma, and her single-word sentence speaks worlds. 
You'd be surprised how little you need to get your points across. Strip 
sentences down to the essentials. Clear out the clutter.<br>
<br>
Henry David Thoreau worked tirelessly in this vein, peeling off unnecessary 
phrases until he reached the pith. In a first draft of Walden, he crafted this 
sentence:<br>
<br>
Over the south shore of the pond which was a low hill covered with shrub oaks &amp; 
scattered pines which seemed to rise to an illimitable tableland— I seemed to 
look toward the country of a new ideal race of Tartars, where tribes of men 
dwelt in tents.<br>
<br>
By the sixth version, Thoreau was able to make the same sentence much more 
elemental:<br>
<br>
The low shrub oak plateau to which the opposite shore arose stretched away 
toward the prairies of the West &amp; the steppes of Tartary, affording ample room 
for all the roving families of men.<br>
<br>
Thoreau simplified his sentence structure, keeping to one main clause and 
restricting himself to one which.<br>
<br>
Sentences can meander— but they should have reason to do so. Virginia Woolf used 
wordathons to explore the labyrinthine interiors of her characters. Jamaica 
Kincaid created one breathless outpouring as a fitting response to a lifetime of 
commandments forced on a girl by her mother. William Faulkner spun out vast 
Southern sagas in sentences that include a 1,300-word doozy beginning &quot;They both 
bore it as though in deliberate flagellant exaltation of physical misery 
transmogrified into the spirits' travail of the two young men during that time 
fifty years ago….&quot;<br>
<br>
Before you go spinning out a 1,300-word opus, heed Hugh Blair, a very emeritus 
Edinburgh professor whose advice has stood the test of two centuries: &quot;Remember… 
every Audience is ready to tire; and the moment they begin to tire, all our 
Eloquence goes for nothing. A loose and verbose manner never fails to create 
disgust… better [to say] too little, than too much.&quot;<br>
<br>
TAKE RISKS.<br>
<br>
Tame savage sentences, combing through them until every hair is in place. Then 
muss them up and see how you like the look.<br>
<br>
Experiment. Be dangerous. Play with words, mixing the curt with the lofty. Play 
with chains of words. Play with phrases and clauses and dashes and full stops. 
Mix short and long, neat and nasty.<br>
<br>
Notice how Cormac McCarthy, in All the Pretty Horses, ever so carefully 
calibrates his sentences. Like the pace of the mounts they're describing, the 
sentences in the following passage start at a controlled clip before stretching 
out into a graceful canter as horses and riders reach the Texas high prairie:<br>
<br>
They rode out along the fenceline and across the open pastureland. The leather 
creaked in the morning cold. They pushed the horses into a lope. The lights fell 
away behind them. They rode out on the high prairie where they slowed the horses 
to a walk and the stars swarmed around them out of the blackness. They heard 
somewhere in that tenantless night a bell that tolled and ceased where no bell 
was and they rode out on the round dais of the earth which alone was dark and no 
light to it and which carried their figures and bore them up into the swarming 
stars so that they rode not under but among them and they rode at once jaunty 
and circumspect, like thieves newly loosed in that dark electric, like young 
thieves in a glowing orchard, loosely jacketed against the cold and ten thousand 
worlds for the choosing.<br>
<br>
McCarthy's paragraph starts with simple sentences. But the final sentence, with 
its infinite phrases and clauses, is as wide and arcing as the night sky.<br>
<br>
Entire sentences can play off one another just as solo words do. Consider the 
patterns. Which best suits your story: lots of staccato? a powerful crescendo? a 
long, slow diminuendo? pure cacophony?<br>
<br>
SEEK BEAUTY.<br>
<br>
T. S. Eliot, in Little Gidding, defined the &quot;right&quot; sentence this way:<br>
<br>
…Every word is at home,<br>
<br>
Taking its place to support the others,<br>
<br>
The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,<br>
<br>
An easy commerce of the old and the new,<br>
<br>
The common word exact without vulgarity,<br>
<br>
The formal word precise but not pedantic,<br>
<br>
The complete consort dancing together.<br>
<br>
Whether minuet, foxtrot, or samba, &quot;the complete consort dancing together&quot; needs 
energy and grace. If you don't pay attention to your every step, sentences will 
flatten out and grow listless.<br>
<br>
How do you keep them lively and lovely? Listen to the way the words combine— the 
cadences, the blending of vowels, the balances and imbalances. The 
nineteenth-century critic George Saintsbury once noted how &quot;shrift ought to be 
sooth&quot; was identical in meaning to &quot;confession ought to be truthful&quot; but very 
different in music. Saintsbury's descendants, Strunk and White, mused similarly 
about Thomas Paine's &quot;These are the times that try men's souls.&quot; They noted how 
changes in phrasing muck up Paine's elegant pentameter:<br>
<br>
Times like these try men's souls.<br>
<br>
How trying it is to live in these times!<br>
<br>
These are trying times for men's souls.<br>
<br>
Soulwise, these are trying times.<br>
<br>
All the alternatives lack the original's spirit.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Whether you call it &quot;turning a phrase&quot; or &quot;line editing,&quot; the simple reordering 
of words can add ineffable beauty to a sentence. Can you hear the subtle 
difference between these two sentences:<br>
<br>
Many of the veterans knew more about the soldiers he was describing than the 
president did.<br>
<br>
Many of the veterans knew more about the soldiers he was describing than did the 
president.<br>
<br>
The ever-so-slight change makes the second more elegant and memorable.<br>
<br>
In What I Saw at the Revolution, speechwriter Peggy Noonan recalls a line she 
wrote for Ronald Reagan about the Democrats:<br>
<br>
They've gone so far left, they left America behind.<br>
<br>
Fearing that the sentence gave Democrats credit for moving forward while the 
rest of the country was stuck in place, Noonan's White House boss, Richard 
Darman, changed two beats and transformed the sentence:<br>
<br>
They're so far left, they've left America.<br>
<br>
FIND THE RIGHT PITCH.<br>
<br>
Why do so many of us, when we sit down to write, sound like word processors 
rather than wordsmiths? Why do we spew the slogans of the consumer culture we 
work for, rather than sounding like the bards we want to be?<br>
<br>
Let's face it, we're surrounded by chatter, clatter, clutter, and cloudiness. We 
read less and watch more, which leaves us swimming in unrefined language, 
unedited sentences, ill-considered commentary. New media offer a world of 
content providers and off-the-cuff &quot;chat,&quot; but little creative inspiration. Our 
litigious times lead us to words full of ominous legality but empty of soaring 
humanity.<br>
<br>
Our sense of language is also blunted by the bureaucratese around us. We try to 
follow politicians like George Bush (&quot;I am less interested in what the 
definition is. You might argue technically, are we in a recession or not. But 
when there's this kind of sluggishness and concern— definitions, heck with it.&quot;) 
and lose our way in the mangled syntax of bureaucrats like Alexander Haig (&quot;We 
must push this to a lower decibel of public fixation. I don't think there's much 
of a learning curve to be achieved in this area of content.&quot;).<br>
<br>
Not all bureaucrats resort to Bushspeak or to Haigiography. Some manage to craft 
simple, clear, and deep sentences that are also human, humble, and real. Take, 
for example, the strong words delivered to Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North by 
senators George Mitchell and Warren Rudman at the end of the Iran-contra 
hearings in 1987. Rudman's crisp sentences convey all the blunt rhythms of his 
New Hampshire roots:<br>
<br>
People in this country oppose aid to the contras…. And that is why this Congress 
has been fickle and vacillates…. I want to point out to you, Colonel North, that 
the Constitution starts with the words, &quot;We the people.&quot; There is no way to 
carry out a consistent policy if we the people disagree with it. Because this 
Congress represents the people. The President of the United States, the greatest 
communicator probably we've seen in the White House in years, has tried for 
eight years, and he's failed…. The last thing I want to say to you, Colonel, is 
[that] the American people have the constitutional right to be wrong.<br>
<br>
Rudman's short sentences, his strong cadences, are perfect foils for the lofty 
democratic ideals he is espousing.<br>
<br>
In language as conversational as Rudman's, George Mitchell uses softer words and 
grander sentences; his cadences reflect his own judicious temperament:<br>
<br>
Now, you've addressed several pleas to this committee— very eloquently…. You 
asked that Congress not cut off aid to the contras &quot;For the love of God and for 
the love of country.&quot; I now address a plea to you. Of all the qualities which 
the American people find compelling about you, none is more impressive than your 
obvious deep devotion to this country. Please remember that others share that 
devotion, and recognize that it is possible for an American to disagree with you 
on aid to the contras and still love God and still love this country just as 
much as you do. Although he's regularly asked to do so, God does not take sides 
in American politics. And in America, disagreement with the policies of the 
government is not evidence of lack of patriotism.<br>
<br>
Fired by the passion of his own patriotism, Mitchell matches the eloquence he 
applauds in North.<br>
<br>
Crafting sentences that are true may be a struggle for politicians, 
professionals, and pure prose stylists, but it can also be an opportunity. 
Writing affords us a luxury we lack in conversation: we can go back to recast 
our sentences, paying attention to syntax and sensuality in a way that's 
impossible when we're expounding extemporaneously— in speaking or in writing. 
And, paradoxically, when rewriting works, the prose sounds natural. It echoes 
our true voices.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;CHAPTER 10&#65532;<br>
<br>
Simple Sentences<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
Now that you've got the notion of subject and predicate, let's dive deeper into 
the waters of the simple sentence. A few definitions before we leap. (You do 
want to outswim the grammar divas, right?)<br>
<br>
We said in the last chapter that a sentence's main verb is &quot;the simple 
predicate.&quot; The rest of the predicate might include other words, phrases, or 
clauses. A sentence comprising one and only one subject-predicate pair is a 
simple sentence.<br>
<br>
In Animals swerve, the subject is animals; the verb is swerve. Those two words 
make a simple sentence. (Animals swerve and flutter through dense walls of green 
has a compound predicate— swerve and flutter through dense walls of green— but 
only one subject, so it's still a simple sentence.)<br>
<br>
The simple sentence comes in four basic patterns. (The sentences that illustrate 
those patterns, like the one in the preceding paragraph, come from Diane 
Ackerman's description of the Brazilian rain forest in The Rarest of the Rare.)<br>
<br>
S + V.<br>
<br>
In the first pattern, the subject is paired with an intransitive verb, as in 
Cicadas buzz or Mosquitoes whine. Intransitive verbs, remember, do not need 
objects to complete an action, so the minimum requirement for a S + V sentence 
is merely a subject and verb. Of course, any number of adjectives and adverbs or 
prepositional phrases may join the fray. In Gemlike hummingbirds swoop among 
bird-of-paradise flowers, the single subject-predicate pair (hummingbirds swoop) 
keeps it a simple sentence:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
s + v + do.<br>
<br>
In the second pattern, the subject is paired with a transitive verb. Transitive 
verbs require direct objects— the noun or pronoun that receives the action— so 
the complete sentence pattern includes the subject, the transitive verb, and the 
direct object: The meek inherit nothing.<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
S + V + IO + O.<br>
<br>
In the third pattern, the subject is paired with a ditransitive verb, which may 
take an indirect object as well as a direct object. Ditransitives include give, 
send, cook, make, prepare, and tell. Indirect objects identify the person or 
thing to whom or for whom something is being done. So here the complete sentence 
pattern includes the subject, the verb, the indirect object, and the direct 
object, usually in that order: The scientists give the monkeys bananas and 
crickets.<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
(This sentence pattern, common though it is, can befuddle grammar novices. 
Perhaps the best mnemonic example is Patrick Henry's &quot;Give me liberty or give me 
death.&quot;)<br>
<br>
&#65532;Objects of our attention.<br>
<br>
S + LV + C.<br>
<br>
In the fourth simple sentence pattern, the subject is paired with a linking 
verb, which is followed by a noun or an adjective called a complement. 
(Complements are also called predicate nouns and predicate adjectives.) The 
linking verb sets up a kind of &quot;relationship of equals&quot; between the subject and 
the complement. The complement may re-identify the subject if it is a noun: in 
&quot;Jungle plants have become incredible tricksters and manipulators, conning 
others into performing sex acts with them,&quot; plants are re-identified as 
tricksters and manipulators.<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
&#65532;Complements, with my compliments.<br>
<br>
The complement can also do the usual modifier thing and describe the subject: in 
&quot;Plants are promiscuous,&quot; promiscuous is a straight-up adjective:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
Remember, linking verbs include state-of-being verbs like to be or to become; 
the &quot;senses&quot; verbs to look, to sound, to feel, to smell, and to taste; and that 
group of verbs including to appear, to prove, to remain, and to seem. 
Occasionally the complement is an adverbial prepositional phrase: Suzy's 
graduation bash will be at the Mokuleia beachhouse.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
In a journalistic rite of passage, new beat reporters with Faulknerian delusions 
are hauled into the city editor's office for an upbraiding. &quot;Remember, kid,&quot; 
begins the salty veteran. &quot;You get paid by the period.&quot;<br>
<br>
For power and punch, nothing beats the simple sentence. The best journalists 
know it cold, and nowhere do they use the simple sentence better than in opening 
paragraphs, known in newspaper parlance as &quot;ledes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crime reporter Gene Miller, now an editor at the Miami Herald, got so good at 
launching stories with a couple of longish sentences followed by one short one 
that his brand of news lede earned its own name: the Miller Chop. Miami Herald 
crime-beat veteran Edna Buchanan, one of his disciples, crafted this lede with 
Miller for a story on the murder of a high-living Miami lawyer:<br>
<br>
…He had his golf clubs in the trunk of his Cadillac. Wednesday looked like an 
easy day. He figured he might pick up a game later with Eddie Arcaro, the 
jockey. He didn't.<br>
<br>
Buchanan, author of The Corpse Had a Familiar Face, has improvised on the Miller 
Chop, crafting what Calvin Trillin calls, in a profile of her, &quot;the simple, 
matter-of-fact statement that registers with a jolt.&quot; On the killing of a rowdy 
ex-con who lurched into a Church's outlet, demanded fried chicken, and started a 
fatal brawl when offered chicken nuggets instead, Buchanan led with this simple 
sentence:<br>
<br>
Gary Robinson died hungry.<br>
<br>
Then there's her lede in a story about a lovers' spat:<br>
<br>
The man she loved slapped her face. Furious, she says she told him never, ever 
to do that again. &quot;What are you going to do, kill me?&quot; he asked, and handed her 
a gun. &quot;Here, kill me,&quot; he challenged. She did.<br>
<br>

<br>
IF YOU THINK THE SIMPLE sentence is solely the province of the Fourth Estate, 
think again. Charlotte Brontë made music out of the S + V + DO sentence 
(punctuated with semicolons rather than periods) in the following passage from 
Villette, in which the narrator awaits reunion with her beloved:<br>
<br>
The sun passes the equinox; the days shorten; the leaves grow sere; but— he is 
coming.<br>
<br>
Frosts appear at night. November has sent his fogs in advance; the wind takes 
its autumn moan; but— he is coming.<br>
<br>
The skies hang full and dark; a rack sails from the west; the clouds case 
themselves into strange forms— arches and broad radiations; there rise 
resplendent mornings— glorious, royal, purple as monarch in his state; the 
heavens are one flame; so wild are they, they rival battle at its thickest— so 
bloody, they shame victory in her pride. I know some signs of the sky, I have 
noted them ever since childhood. God watch that sail! Oh, guard it!<br>

Muhammad Ali makes a wholly different kind of poetry out of the simple sentence. 
While in Zaire in 1974 preparing for his &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; against 
heavyweight champion George Foreman, Ali forged this unforgettable S + V + DO 
rap:<br>
<br>
Only last week, I murdered a rock. Injured a stone. Hospitalized a brick. I'm so 
mean, I make medicine sick.<br>

PURPLE PROSE.<br>
<br>
By one account, Samuel Johnson suffered when he picked up a revised version of 
the New Testament at the country house of a friend. There, in the eleventh 
chapter of John, he found the simple, touching words &quot;Jesus wept&quot; 
unceremoniously replaced with &quot;Jesus, the Saviour of the world, overcome with 
grief, burst into a flood of tears.&quot; Dr. Sam blew a gasket.<br>
<br>
So should you when you find purple prose ruining a good read. But what, exactly, 
is purple prose? For some famously atrocious sentences, let's turn again to 
winners of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest for the worst opening lines of 
(hypothetical) lousy novels. You may not recognize Edward George Bulwer-Lytton's 
name, but you know his words (from the opening of Paul Clifford): &quot;It was a dark 
and stormy night.&quot; The litterateurs who ranked high in the competition created 
doozies like these:<br>
<br>
The sun oozed over the horizon, shoved aside darkness, crept along the 
greensward, and, with sickly fingers, pushed through the castle window, 
revealing the pillaged princess, hand at throat, crown asunder, gaping in 
frenzied horror at the sated, sodden amphibian lying beside her, disbelieving 
the magnitude of the frog's deception, screaming madly, &quot;You lied!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a curvaceous figure that Venus would have envied, a tanned, unblemished 
oval face framed with lustrous thick brown hair, deep azure-blue eyes fringed 
with long black lashes, perfect teeth that vied for competition, and a small 
straight nose, Marilee had a beauty that defied description.<br>
<br>
Marilee's beauty may have defied description, but it inspired purple prose. 
Unless you're competing in spoof writing contests, tame sentences like these. 
Break 'em up. And while you're at it, could ya trim a few adjectives?<br>
<br>
PLAIN BORING.<br>
<br>
Every now and then, the Plain English movement— a loose network of government 
and business types crusading to get rid of gobbledygook— reappears in the news. 
Jimmy Carter heeded its calls for deflating prose through short sentences, 
everyday words, and an avoidance of jargon, and Bill Clinton signed an executive 
order demanding that government agencies use Plain English. Those are noble 
goals. But if bureaucrats banish lively sentences in the name of Plain English, 
have we won the battle but lost the war? How many recipients of this insipid 
letter from the U.S. Postal Service read to the end?<br>
<br>
DEAR POSTAL CUSTOMER<br>
<br>
We sincerely regret the damage to your mail that occurred during handling in the 
post service.<br>
<br>
We realize how important your mail is and you have every right to expect it to 
be delivered intact and in good condition. We are very concerned with incidents 
such as this and do everything possible to reduce mail damage to the lowest 
possible level.<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that the post office handles millions of pieces daily, it is 
imperative that mechanical methods be used. Heavy volume and modern production 
methods do not permit personal attention to individual pieces of mail.<br>
<br>
Most problems occur when contents become separated from poorly prepared 
envelopes or containers. This causes damage to that piece as well as any 
properly prepared mail that may follow it. No matter how careful we are, mail 
will occasionally be damaged.<br>
<br>
Whatever the circumstances, please accept our apologies for this most 
unfortunate incident.<br>
<br>
PLANT MANAGER BULK MAIL CENTER<br>
<br>
That letter should have been signed &quot;The Bulk Writing Center.&quot; Sure, it follows 
the rules of Plain English— &quot;use short sentences, plain words, active voice, and 
friendly pronouns&quot;— but it also uses mealy-mouthed modifiers (sincerely, very, 
important); relies on redundancies (intact and in good condition and reduce to 
the lowest possible level); and gives airtime to due to the fact that. As for 
that &quot;Most problems occur when…&quot;— please, spare us the details! And don't blame 
the sender.<br>
<br>
Perhaps recipients still wouldn't read a more succinct letter, but wouldn't you 
rather save federal ink? Try this:<br>
<br>
We apologize for damaging your mail.<br>
<br>
Because the post office handles millions of items daily, we must rely on 
mechanical processing rather than personally handling each piece. We do take 
great care to minimize damage, which is often caused when one envelope gums up 
the works.<br>
<br>
We realize how much you value letters and packages and do our best to deliver 
them in good condition. Again, our sincere apologies.<br>
<br>
WHO KNOWS GRAMMAR BETTER THAN WHOM?<br>
<br>
There is only one good answer to the question &quot;Whom shall I say is calling?&quot; 
That answer is: &quot;Someone who knows grammar better than you do.&quot; (The correct 
question would be &quot;Who shall I say is calling?&quot;)<br>
<br>
Sentence syntax makes the distinction between who and whom so easy you're gonna 
cry. Think subjects and objects. Who is the subject of a sentence or of a 
clause: Who is calling? Whom is the object of a verb or of a preposition: You 
are calling whom? or To whom shall I direct your call? If you're ever in any 
doubt about whether to use who or whom, substitute he and him in the same 
sentence. If he (a pronoun in the subjective case) sounds right, stick to who 
(another pronoun in the subjective case). If him sounds right (a pronoun in the 
objective case), go with whom (another pronoun in the objective case).<br>
<br>
Sometimes, especially in sentences containing an internal clause, it takes a bit 
of parsing to figure out whether a pronoun is a subject or an object: With 
&quot;Who/Whom shall I say is calling?&quot; you must evaporate out the internal clause; 
you're left with either the grammatically gorgeous &quot;Who is calling?&quot; or the 
boner &quot;Whom is calling?&quot;<br>
<br>
And finally, since we've done away with the shibboleth about not ending 
sentences with prepositions, go ahead and use who at the beginning of a question 
if whom seems unbearably British: &quot;Who did you go to the nightclub with?&quot; 
(Asking &quot;Whom did you go to the nightclub with?&quot;— or, worse, &quot;With whom did you 
go to the nightclub?&quot;— will brand you as terminally unhip.)<br>
<br>
In spoken English, whom anywhere in the sentence is often considered stiff, 
pretentious. Use what fits best. But err knowingly, and take pleasure in the 
company of those before you who have done so: Shakespeare allowed King Lear to 
ask &quot;To who, my lord?&quot; (shoulda been &quot;to whom&quot;), and the translators of the King 
James Bible allowed &quot;Whom say men that I am?&quot; (shoulda been who, as in &quot;Men say 
that I am who?&quot;).<br>
<br>
LAY THIS ERROR TO REST.<br>
<br>
When Sing and Snore Ernie débuted on toy store shelves, the talking Muppet 
committed a cardinal sin: He uttered, &quot;It feels good to lay down.&quot; Sing and 
Snore Ernie joined the august company of Byron (&quot;there let him lay&quot;) and Bob 
Dylan (&quot;Lay lady lay&quot;) in confusing lay, the transitive verb, with lie, the 
intransitive verb. Granted, Bob Dylan was talking about some serious sinning, 
but not of the grammatical sort. You should keep in mind that lay needs a direct 
object; lie needs no object. Sing and Snore Ernie meant &quot;It feels good to lie 
down.&quot; After lying down, though, he could have said &quot;Now I lay me down to 
sleep,&quot; and he would have been correct, thanks to the direct object &quot;myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
A copywriter for the watchmaker Tourneau must have liked lying down, too, or was 
just half asleep when penning this ad: &quot;If you are fortunate enough to have an 
old watch or two laying around….&quot; The poor professional was busted by William 
Safire, who scolded: &quot;The present participle should be the intransitive lying, 
not the transitive laying, which requires an object like a Fabergé egg.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;IT'S ME&quot; IS OK, BUT &quot;THIS IS HER&quot; IS UNFORGIVABLE.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello,&quot; you say, answering the phone. &quot;May I speak to the head of the 
household?&quot; the telemarketer asks. It may sound stuffy to reply &quot;This is she,&quot; 
but it is correct. (Who wants to cozy up to a goddam telemarketer anyway?) 
Remember, a S + LV + C sentence puts the subject and the predicate on an equal 
footing, so a noun complement should be in the subjective, not the objective 
case. Do not utter &quot;This is her&quot; or &quot;This is him.&quot;<br>
<br>
A concession to the linguistically loose is, however, in order here. The 
technically &quot;incorrect&quot; It's me and That's me have become part of our DNA. Maybe 
we just crave a simple English equivalent of the French C'est moi. There's 
something nice and humble about It's me and That's me, and it would be crazy to 
insist on &quot;It is I&quot; and &quot;That is I.&quot; (&quot;If somebody knocked at my door and called 
'It's I,'&nbsp;&quot; a New York schoolteacher once told the New York Times, &quot;I'd faint.&quot;) 
So go ahead, be ungrammatical if it feels right.<br>

What would advertising be without the short and declarative? If a tag line 
sticks in your mind, it's probably because it's a simple sentence. Of course, 
admen and -women spice up their copy with slang and muss up punctuation so as 
not to seem too straight and narrow.<br>
<br>
Brylcreem's &quot;A little dab'll do ya,&quot; from 1966, is straight S + V + DO. So's 
&quot;Flick Your Bic,&quot; with which the ad agency Wells Rich Greene turned the brand 
known for indestructible pens (stylos that withstood flames) into a brand known 
for fire itself. In one oh-so-seventies spot for the disposable lighter, a woman 
declares, &quot;Myron and I have a liberated marriage. I flick his Bic as often as he 
flicks mine.&quot; Mmmmm. Direct object as object of desire.<br>
<br>
Speaking of objects of desire: Goodby Silverstein's &quot;got milk?&quot; campaign shrinks 
the phrase &quot;Do you have&quot; down to &quot;got&quot; and gives &quot;milk&quot; equal billing in the 
sentence. (Why, the sentence isn't even capitalized!) Result: the direct object 
milk gets all the attention.<br>

SALON, THE ONLINE MAGAZINE where the digerati meet the literati, held a contest 
in early 1998 to poke fun at the soullessness of on-screen language. Salon 
challenged readers to consider the error message, written by coders to inform 
you that you must reboot and start all over. The programmed missive usually 
brings bad news in worse prose: &quot;abort/retry/fail?&quot; and &quot;404— file not found.&quot; 
(Translation: you have just lost all your work and you are wasting your time.)<br>
<br>
Inviting readers to submit error messages, Salon required that they be written 
in 5/7/5 haiku (three-liners in which the first line contains five syllables, 
the second line seven, and the third line five). The best entries were— you 
guessed it— simple sentences:<br>

<br>
Phrases and Clauses<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
If sentences are streams of thought, phrases and clauses are the creeks and 
underground springs that feed them. Like sentences, phrases and clauses have 
beginnings and endings, and they flow in a clear direction.<br>
<br>
Phrases are simple word groupings— bits of organized thought that are part of 
the complete idea behind a sentence. &quot;A phrase can't do much of anything alone,&quot; 
Karen Elizabeth Gordon writes in The Deluxe Transitive Vampire, &quot;but it's 
positively a virtuoso when it comes to embellishing, showing relationships, and 
giving you many different ways to arrange the rest of the sentence, which it 
needs to fulfill its promise.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, who are these virtuosi?<br>
<br>
• The noun phrase. This cluster of words, such as that obscure object of desire, 
acts as the subject or direct object of a sentence.<br>
<br>
• The verb phrase. Working in concert, the main verb and its helpers constitute 
the verb phrase, as in had been chattering.<br>
<br>
• The appositive phrase. This phrase clarifies a nearby noun by renaming it in 
different words. &quot;Miss Goldenfingers, my typing teacher, was fond of 
tongue-twisters.&quot; (These identifiers are especially prevalent in news articles, 
offering a quick way to identify a source: &quot;Sammy Sosa, the home-run wonder, 
grew up using a cut-open milk carton as a baseball glove.&quot;) Appositives are 
usually, though not always, enclosed in commas.<br>
<br>
• The prepositional phrase. Comprising a preposition and its object, the phrase 
over the lazy dog, gives us the preposition (over), the object (dog), and the 
object's own modifier (lazy). Some phrases do the usual adverbial foxtrot: in 
&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,&quot; the phrase over the lazy dog 
tells Where the fox jumps. Adjectival prepositional phrases modify a noun; in 
&quot;Time is a river without banks,&quot; the phrase without banks tells us what kind of 
river Time resembles. When a prepositional phrase kicks off a sentence, it is 
usually followed by a comma: &quot;Over the lazy dog, the fox pirouetted.&quot;<br>
<br>
• The verbals— infinitive, participial, and gerund phrases. These are fun, if 
dangerous, devices. (For the dangerous part, see Cardinal Sins.) Infinitive 
phrases behave as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs: In the sentence &quot;To err is 
human, to forgive divine,&quot; the infinitive phrases to err and to forgive are 
nouns; in &quot;the lonesome whippoorwill sounds too blue to fly,&quot; the phrase to fly 
acts as an adverb (How blue?). Participial phrases are marked by either the 
present or the past participle of a verb, but in sentences they behave as 
adjectives: in &quot;Swearing he'd rather fight than switch, the hunk lit up,&quot; 
everything before the comma modifies the noun hunk. Gerund phrases also end in 
-ing, but they always behave as nouns: the weeping of the robin and the crawling 
of time made Hank Williams so lonesome he could cry.<br>
<br>
• Absolute phrase. These are actually full sentences from which the verb has 
gone AWOL— either morphing into a verbal phrase or disappearing into the mist. 
In the sentence &quot;The bottle of Zin having been drained, we grabbed the Cab,&quot; the 
absolute phrase suggests a full sentence: The bottle of Zin has been drained. 
The absolute phrase functions as an adjective, but it modifies the entire 
sentence or clause rather than a single noun within it. Because of this, 
absolute phrases cannot dangle. Like participial phrases, absolute phrases are 
set apart from the rest of the sentence by commas.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Participling the waters….<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
WIDER AND DEEPER THAN A PHRASE is the clause. It contains a subject and a 
predicate, but, like a phrase, a clause flows into a larger sentence.<br>
<br>
An independent clause could stand alone as a sentence, but finds other clauses 
clinging to it. Independent clauses might be coupled— linked by a conjunction, a 
relative pronoun, or a hearty piece of punctuation (a semicolon, say): in 
&quot;Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures,&quot; the two independent 
clauses are joined with the conjunction but.<br>
<br>
A dependent clause cannot stand alone; it acts as a noun, adjective, or adverb 
within the sentence. One kind of dependent clause starts with a subordinate 
conjunction: in &quot;Marriage, if one will face the truth, is an evil, but a 
necessary evil,&quot; if one will face the truth is a dependent clause introduced by 
the subordinate conjunction if. Another kind of dependent clause starts with a 
relative pronoun, such as who, whom, whose, that, which, whoever, and whomever: 
In &quot;Never say that marriage has more of joy than pain,&quot; the relative clause that 
marriage has more of joy than pain acts as a direct object of the verb say.<br>
<br>
That brings us to one troublesome fork in the clause delta: that or which? When 
dependent clauses are adjectival— that is, when they describe or define a noun 
or pronoun— they begin either with that or with which. Grammarians have probably 
devoted as much ink to that and which as they have to anything, but confusion 
remains— in profusion!<br>
<br>
Here's what you need to know: First of all, forget those notions of which being 
more proper. The Brits favor which, but that predominates in the more relaxed 
American letters. Use that whenever a clause is necessary to understand the 
meaning of the sentence. In &quot;Elizabeth Taylor could address the questions that 
you have about marriage,&quot; the clause is necessary: &quot;Elizabeth Taylor could 
address the questions&quot; is too vague— we are left wondering what questions she 
could address. (No offense, Liz.) Use which whenever the clause adds 
information, but could just as easily be left out of the sentence: &quot;All these 
questions, which concern the merits and demerits of independence and dependence, 
could be asked of Liz, you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
While that clauses tend to follow straight after the word they modify and need 
no punctuation, which clauses provide extraneous info and are usually enclosed 
in commas.<br>
<br>
&#65532;The wedding cake or the icing?<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
The cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, in The Language Instinct, writes that 
phrases and clauses offer &quot;one solution to the engineering problem of taking an 
interconnected web of thoughts in the mind and encoding them as a string of 
words that must be uttered, one at a time, by the mouth.&quot; The more complex the 
idea, the more complexity is required in the form of the sentence. But words, 
phrases, and clauses all work together toward the same end: to keep sentences as 
simple and clear as possible.<br>
<br>
Phrases and clauses affect style as well as substance. Phrases can unstarch 
sentences and give them grace. Notice, for example, the beautiful fluidity 
imparted by participial phrases in John F. Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address:<br>
<br>
Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that 
the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, born in this 
century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our 
ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those 
human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are 
committed today at home and around the world.<br>
<br>
Kennedy's string of participial phrases works so well because the phrases are so 
symmetrical— semantically and rhythmically. Kennedy keeps his parts parallel: in 
each phrase, the adjective (born, tempered, disciplined, proud, unwilling) is 
followed by a prepositional phrase; the rhythm crescendos as each phrase 
stretches a little longer than the previous one.<br>
<br>
Like Kennedy, Thomas Jefferson kept his parts parallel, turning to the relative 
clause when he was crafting the rich sentences that begin the Declaration of 
Independence:<br>
<br>
We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that 
they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among 
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these 
rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from 
the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes 
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish 
it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, 
and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to 
effect their safety and happiness.<br>
<br>
Each relative clause begins with that; all the clauses are parallel, and all 
hold together in exquisite tension— allowing Jefferson to fluidly and memorably 
bind his ideas.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
SO WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT trying to write soaring national appeals? What if you're 
just looking for a way to lessen the staccato of successive simple sentences? 
Try downgrading some declarative sentences to independent clauses tied together 
with coordinate conjunctions like and or but. Or let a single subject have 
multiple predicates. News stories often get their fluidity out of such linking, 
as in this lead from an Associated Press story:<br>
<br>
Colin Powell ruled out a 1996 bid for the White House Wednesday and said he 
wouldn't be a candidate for vice president either. He declared himself a 
Republican, but wouldn't commit himself to vote for the GOP nominee next year.<br>
<br>
There are other ways to pack a lede with information while keeping the sentences 
limber. Notice how Francis X. Clines, of the New York Times, finesses the same 
problem (and the same story):<br>
<br>
Resisting an enormous popular drumbeat for his candidacy, Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
the hero of the Gulf War, declined today to compete in the 1996 Presidential 
election because, he admitted, he lacked &quot;a passion and commitment that, despite 
my every effort, I do not have for political life.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clines uses every arrow in his quiver: he starts with the softening participial 
phrase (Resisting an enormous popular drumbeat for his candidacy), drops in the 
subject, adds an appositive (the hero of the Gulf War) and Powell's relative 
clauses (that… I do not have for political life), and uses subordinate 
conjunctions (because and despite) for everything they're worth.<br>
<br>

Some of the most hilarious errors in English result from phrases that aren't 
properly tracked. If you don't know what you're doing, phrases will deliver you 
straight to The Danger Zone.<br>
<br>
DANGLING DOOZIES.<br>
<br>
The most common and comical sin is called the Dangling Participle. Remember, 
participles exist so that verbs can modify nouns. Dangling participles are 
adjectival phrases that have come unmoored from the nouns they are supposed to 
modify and instead modify the nearest noun they can find. Here's a dangling 
participle reprinted in the New Yorker as a space filler:<br>
<br>
In San Diego, the &quot;in&quot; place for years has been McDini's for corned beef. Thinly 
sliced and heaped on rye, corned beef lovers won't be disappointed.<br>
<br>
When was the last time you were thinly sliced and heaped on rye?<br>
<br>
Here's one lifted from Constance Schrader in Our Town:<br>
<br>
For over a half-century Rumpelmayer's has been one of New York's most popular 
ice-cream parlors. Decorated with cuddly stuffed animals and trimmed with large 
pink velvet bows, you feel like you're sitting inside a present.<br>
<br>
It's hard to say which is worse, being thinly sliced and heaped on rye, or being 
decorated with cuddly stuffed animals and trimmed with large pink velvet bows.<br>
<br>
Classified newspaper ads are a great source of dangling-participle howlers, like 
this one from a shopper in San Mateo, California:<br>
<br>
Redwood City Trailer Rancho: single-wide, 1-bedroom, 1-bath, queen-size bed, 
pets, children OK if neutered or spayed.<br>
<br>
The things they do to their kids in Redwood City!<br>
<br>
There's nothing new about dangling participles. Here's one from a notice fixed 
on a Hertfordshire door in nineteenth-century England:<br>
<br>
This is to give notice that no person is to be buried in this churchyard but 
those living in the parish; and those who wish to be buried are desired to apply 
to me. Ephraim Grubb, Parish Clerk.<br>
<br>
Surely Ephraim meant well, but living in the parish modifies those who wish to 
be buried. Doesn't burying people alive seem a little, well, pagan?<br>
<br>
MORE MAYHEM.<br>
<br>
Participials aren't the only phrases known to dangle. If prepositional phrases 
are not placed next to the word they modify, Mayday! Here's a dangler from a 
collection of &quot;genuine, authentic, and unretouched student bloopers&quot; collected 
by Richard Lederer in Anguished English:<br>
<br>
Abraham Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg address while traveling from Washington to 
Gettysburg on the back of an envelope.<br>
<br>
Some people have magic carpets, some people have magic envelopes.<br>
<br>
And some people have magic piano cases. Here's another real ad from the 
classifieds:<br>
<br>
FOR SALE: an Erard grand piano, the property of a lady about to travel in a 
walnut-wood case with carved legs.<br>
<br>
Then there's the lady with, er, magic legs:<br>
<br>
FOR SALE: Mahogany table by a lady with Chippendale legs.<br>
<br>
The offending preposition in that first ad is in. In the second, it's with.<br>
<br>
This prepositional dangler appeared in the Los Angeles Times:<br>
<br>
Pop star Whitney Houston will make her first Southern California concert 
appearance since the birth of her daughter at the Hollywood Bowl on August 22.<br>
<br>
That bit of bad phrasing was snagged by the New Yorker (again!), which wryly 
commented that Whitney Houston has &quot;probably been trying to figure out how to 
top her last show.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, here's someone on intimate terms with the comedy lurking in dangling 
things. Groucho Marx made his prepositional slips intentionally, like this one 
from Animal Crackers:<br>
<br>
I once shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I'll never 
know.<br>
<br>
MISCELLANEOUS MISFIRES.<br>
<br>
Writers careless with phrases can create havoc in all kinds of ways. Sometimes 
their phrases dangle, sometimes they just hopelessly tangle. The Brooklyn Church 
Music Committee received the following (unintentional?) gender-bending reply to 
a job it advertised back in the 1800s:<br>
<br>
Gentleman, I noticed your advertisement for organist and music teacher, either 
lady or gentleman. Having been both for several years, I offer you my services.<br>
<br>
The Church Music Committee was lucky to get an applicant. You can't help but 
wonder if the following contemporaneous classified ad was ever answered:<br>
<br>
WANTED: A woman to wash, iron and milk two cows.<br>
<br>
Ironing cows is, after all, a rare skill.<br>
<br>
How 'bout this book dedication by a writer who abandoned the serial comma (i.e., 
the comma preceding and in a list) and in doing so created a delusional 
appositive:<br>
<br>
This book is dedicated to my parents, Ayn Rand and God.<br>

Because we think in chunks, not just words, phrases and clauses in pidgins and 
dialects can make for some wacko linguistic odysseys. In that breezy language 
tango called Spanglish, words, phrases, and entire sentences swing back and 
forth between English and Spanish. A handy Spanish word might stand in for an 
English one, or an English word might be hijacked into Spanish— &quot;chilling out&quot; 
becomes chileando, and &quot;e-mail&quot; becomes e-mailiar. Notice the switch-hitting in 
the lyrics of a Los Lobos song:<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's go bailando, noche's looking fine, jump into the carro, drink a bunch of 
wine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cristina Saralegui, a celebrity on the Univision Network, claims that even her 
miniature dachshund, Cosa, speaks Spanglish. When Cristina tells her dog, 
&quot;Bajate de la cama!&quot; (Get off the bed!) Cosa ignores her. Only when she insists, 
&quot;Cosa, por favor, get down,&quot; does the dog obey. Whether you're a person or a 
perro, the key to Spanglish is fluency not just with single words, but with 
groups of words— phrases— like Que no? or Yo se, or Oye, chica.<br>
<br>
In the Hawaiian creole known as Pidgin English, syntax is scrambled and words 
from different languages— Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino— are folded into 
English sentences. The popular song &quot;Manuela Boy&quot; includes this refrain:<br>
<br>
Manuela Boy, my dear boy<br>
<br>
You no more hilahila<br>
<br>
No more five cents, no more house<br>
<br>
Go A'ala Paka hiamoe.<br>
<br>
Hilahila is Hawaiian for &quot;shame&quot;; the phrases in the last line jump from 
language to language: Go is obviously an English imperative (&quot;you go&quot;); A'ala 
Paka is a hybrid, a transliteration of A'ala Park; hiamoe is Hawaiian for the 
infinitive phrase &quot;to fall asleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Hawaiian writer Lois-Ann Yamanaka plays with Pidgin English in her novels of 
life in the fiftieth state. Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers tells the story of 
Lovey Nariyoshi, a young girl growing up in Hilo, with its patois of Polynesian 
words (luna, lanai), Japanese phrases (kendo sensei), and Hawaiian-English 
hybrids (haolified, haole-ish):<br>
<br>
My other neighbor Katy and me sit on her porch across the street from my house. 
It's really Katy's mother's house with the big jacaranda tree in the front yard 
and a white wicker swing like the plantation lunas have on their lanais.<br>
<br>
I put Katy's big, swollen legs on an old apple crate. She says, &quot;Eh, Lovey, try 
press my legs. So swollen going have one white dot where you wen' press your 
finger. Try.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do and the white dot on one of her swollen red legs stays for a second, then 
fades back to brown. I make four dots with all fingers at once and Katy laughs. 
We drink Kool-Aid with lots of ice cubes.<br>
<br>
Katy says she likes the name Charlene if she has a girl and Charles if she has a 
boy. Named after her ji-chan who was a kendo sensei at a dojo near the pancake 
house by the airport.<br>
<br>
I give her my suggestions since lately I've been Katy's main visitor. &quot;Autumn, 
Summer, or Heather for a girl….&quot;<br>
<br>
Katy says, &quot;When the baby comes, I let you bathe him and change his diaper like 
that. But no name him— you too haolified with your names, Lovey. Who you think 
you? Sometimes you act too haole-ish to me. You crazy— you like be haole or 
what?&quot; I don't say anything. Katy goes on. &quot;I know I got one boy in here. But I 
gotta name um.&quot;<br>
&#65532;&#65532;CHAPTER 12&#65532;<br>
<br>
Sentence Variety<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
The best sentences unify their elements— clear subjects and predicates, elegant 
phrases, clauses that twist and turn and surprise— into a strong, coursing 
stream. Structurally, they may be simple sentences— containing one subject or 
predicate along with any number of adjectives, adverbs, or phrases. But if a 
sentence contains more than one subject-predicate pair, more than one clause, it 
qualifies as one of the following:<br>
<br>
A compound sentence. When two independent clauses, each detailing a complete 
action, are hitched by a coordinate conjunction, the two parts balance each 
other in weight and importance. At the same time, hitching them together brings 
separate ideas into juxtaposition, as in Mark Twain's &quot;Tell the truth or trump— 
but get the trick.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pay attention to punctuation: independent clauses in a compound sentence require 
a coordinate conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) and a comma or a 
dash. When you want to bolt the clauses together without the softening influence 
of a conjunction, use a bracing piece of punctuation like Mark Twain's semicolon 
in the following: &quot;Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; 
cauliflower is nothing but a cabbage with a college education.&quot;<br>
<br>
• A complex sentence. Here, one or more &quot;dependent&quot; clauses lean on an 
independent clause. What dooms a clause to dependency? Subordinate conjunctions 
(like if, since, or while) and relative pronouns (who, whomever, that). Take 
Mark Twain's maxim about the principal difference between a dog and a man: &quot;If 
you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you.&quot; The 
sentence begins with a subordinate clause, If you pick up a starving dog and 
make him prosperous, followed by an independent clause, he will not bite you. A 
complex sentence has an internal dynamic: the clauses have a distinct 
relationship to each other and allow us to emphasize the relationship of ideas.<br>
<br>
If a subordinate clause begins a complex sentence, it must be separated from the 
independent clause by a comma.<br>
<br>
• A compound-complex sentence. This contains one or more dependent clauses and 
at least two independent clauses. Mark Twain did these sentences, too: &quot;When 
angry, count to four; when very angry, swear.&quot; When angry is a dependent clause 
leaning on the independent count to four, and when very angry is a dependent 
clause leaning on swear. This short but intense sentence holds several different 
ideas, operating on different levels, in place.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
Mark Twain, who was a master of memorable sentences, favored the short and 
pithy. To the writer itching to indulge in a long sentence, he counseled: &quot;Make 
sure that there are no folds in it, no vaguenesses, no parenthetical 
interruptions of its view as a whole; when [you have] done with it, it won't be 
a sea-serpent with half of its arches under the water, it will be a torch-light 
procession.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#65532;Balancing acts.<br>
<br>
Simple sentences offer the most straightforward way to get to the point quickly 
and clearly. But when you want your writing to have the stately grace of a 
torchlight procession, you can play with syntax and style— with the contrast of 
short and long, with rhythm and repetition, with pauses and parentheticals, with 
endings that bang and endings that whimper.<br>
<br>
Even in a story that demands a quiet tone and humble language, sentence variety 
prevents the narrative from becoming choppy. Simplicity and spareness, for 
example, are perfectly appropriate in a memoir, published in the Honolulu 
Advertiser, of Antone Correa, a Portuguese immigrant who toiled forty-four years 
as a laborer on a Hawaiian sugar plantation, and thirty more years in his own 
backyard. The words are simple, but the sentence structure has all the variety 
of Papa's potted plants:<br>
<br>
Clearly, Papa had once been handsome. His face, in repose, was still remarkable: 
eyes sunk deep between prominent cheekbones, a set of enormously bushy 
gray-black eyebrows, both high forehead and arched nose noble in bearing, skin 
brown and leathery and stretched taut overhis jaw.<br>
<br>
But by the time we knew Papa, his body was hinged at the waist and starting to 
wither. He always wore baggy plantation khakis, and a white cotton shirt. I 
never saw him in a pair of shoes. Instead, he wore leather thongs that crossed 
over his toes, which bunched together like overgrown tree roots. His legs had 
weakened: he used a walker to move around the house and the yard. The walker 
kept his upper body strong. He was barrel-chested, with thick hairy arms and 
stubby fingers. One of his fingers was a stump, as a result of an accident with 
a saw. Stump or no, he had a gentle touch.<br>
<br>
Despite his difficulty walking, Papa was a tremendous gardener. Beds of flowers 
and ferns surrounded the house, but Papa spent even more time caring for 
countless potted plants, on several raised wooden platforms in the backyard. 
There— in old coffee tins— he sprouted trees and raised vegetables. He was 
forever sending us home with avocados and bananas.<br>
<br>
That description of a simple man mixes simple sentences, a variety of phrases, 
compound sentences, and one complex sentence.<br>
<br>

<br>
WHEN WINSTON CHURCHILL ADDRESSED the House of Commons in 1940, after the defeat 
at Dunkirk, he exploited the straightforward sentence for all its determined 
power:<br>
<br>
We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, 
we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence 
and strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, 
we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall 
fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall 
never surrender.<br>
<br>
Churchill knew the value of parallelism. His speech comprises a succession of S 
+ V sentences and clauses (only &quot;we shall defend our island&quot; stands apart 
structurally as a S + V + DO). In the compelling, swelling compound sentence, 
Churchill keeps his subject and verb (we shall fight) steady and creates a 
powerful crescendo. When Churchill breaks his incantation with we shall never 
surrender, the structural change emphasizes his resolve.<br>
<br>
You don't always have to be so tidy. Look at what Gabriel García Márquez 
unleashes in the opening of Autumn of the Patriarch:<br>
<br>
Over the weekend the vultures got into the presidential palace by pecking 
through the screens on the balcony windows and the flapping of their wings 
stirred up the stagnant time inside, and at dawn on Monday the city awoke out of 
its lethargy of centuries with the warm, soft breeze of a great man dead and 
rotting grandeur.<br>
<br>
García Márquez's winding masterpiece comprises three main clauses (the vultures 
got, the flapping of their wings stirred up, and the city awoke) and innumerable 
phrases, all befitting his magical-realist style. The sentence arcs slowly, like 
the vultures it describes.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
THE ART OF SENTENCE-MAKING comes down to variety. Just because you can do the 
three-and-a-half somersault tuck off the high board doesn't mean you must ditch 
the gorgeous swan dive. Good sentences can be short and muscular and they can be 
long and graceful. Like the imagination, they shift and surprise. You, the 
writer, must play with them. Try a sentence one way, then another. The English 
critic George Saintsbury once compared the secret of sentence-making— the 
letting out and pulling in of clauses— to the letting out and pulling in of the 
slides of a trombone or the &quot;draws&quot; of a telescope.<br>
<br>
The contrast of a lone short sentence amid long ones can add emphasis. A 
one-word sentence or fragment can stop readers in their tracks— and can mirror 
the action of the narrative. Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee 
effectively contrasted long sentences and fragments in his memoir, A Good Life:<br>
<br>
Some stories are hard to see, generally because the clues are hidden or 
disguised. By accident, or on purpose. Other stories hit you in the face. Like 
Watergate, for instance.<br>
<br>
Had Bradlee deleted that &quot;for instance,&quot; he would have had a killer fragment.<br>
<br>
The New Yorker's Roger Angell uses every play in the sentence book when writing 
about running into Willie Mays at the Giants' Scottsdale Stadium in Arizona. 
Angell notes that Mays's psychological defenses often discourage conversation 
with fans and followers. Consequently, interviewers have a hard time lighting up 
what Angell calls Mays's &quot;Proustian hot stove.&quot; But then &quot;a visiting senior 
writer from back East&quot; (i.e., Angell) brings up the Billy Cox play, and the 
sentences take on the unpredictability of hits, runs, and outs:<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn!&quot; Mays cried excitedly. &quot;You saw that? You were there?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, the writer had been there— as a fan at the Polo Grounds. &quot;August, 1951,&quot; he 
said. &quot;Cox was the base runner at third. You caught the ball running full tilt 
toward right, turned in midair, and threw him out at the plate. You threw before 
you could get turned around— let the ball go with your back to the plate. The 
throw went to the catcher on the fly— it must have been Westrum— and he tagged 
Cox out, sliding.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You got it!&quot; Mays said. &quot;I've been sayin' this for a long time, and nobody here 
believes me.&quot; He was kidding, of course, but his voice had come up at last: 
almost the old, high Willie piping. &quot;Now tell 'em how it was.&quot;<br>
<br>
I told it again— it was easy because I'd never seen such a play, before or 
since— and, as I did, it seemed to me that Willie Mays and I could still see the 
long, curving flight of the white ball through the afternoon light, bang into 
the big mitt, and the slide and the amazing out, and together remember the 
expanding moment when the staring players on the field and those just emerging 
from the dugouts, and the shouting fans, and maybe even the startled 
twenty-year-old rookie center fielder himself, now retrieving his fallen cap 
from the grass, understood that something new and electric had just begun to 
happen to baseball.<br>
<br>
Angell's final sentence is as risky, as borderline out-of-control, as savagely 
confident, as was that throw to home by Willie Mays, with his back to the plate.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
SKEW LINES.<br>
<br>
To string together phrases and clauses for rhetorical effect, remember that 
Churchillian rhetoric works because of parallel structure. Parallelism— internal 
syntactical balance— requires that you use similar phrasing for each element of 
the list. If you can't keep track of your phrases and clauses, you will end up 
with linguistic rats' nests instead of elegant parallels.<br>
<br>
William Safire caught this infelicity in an ad for Harvard Business School: 
&quot;What's innovative, time-tested, diverse, intense, global and develops leaders?&quot; 
The problem with Harvard's list is that the first five elements are adjectives, 
and the last is a clause. Not parallel. Not good.<br>
<br>
One media critic tried to get away with this paragraph on Elvis:<br>
<br>
The symbol of rock and roll rebellion returned a mutant, a maker of dumb 
Hawaiian beach movies, a troubled superstar stuffing himself with drugs, passing 
out Cadillac cars like candy bars, with a retinue living in a tacky mansion and, 
eventually, a Vegas act whose jeweled jumpsuits now come more readily to mind 
than the quiet, oblivious, oddball kid.<br>
<br>
A sharp copy editor tamed that sentence, whose various parts career from 
appositives to participials to prepositionals. Here's the parallel version; each 
modifying phrase is anchored by a clear noun phrase:<br>
<br>
The symbol of rock-and-roll rebellion returned to the States a mutant: a pretty 
face gracing dumb Hawaiian beach movies, a troubled superstar stuffing himself 
with drugs, an aging freak passing out Cadillac cars like candy bars, a 
patriarch lording over a retinue living in a tacky mansion, and, eventually, a 
Vegas act whose jeweled jumpsuits now come more readily to mind than the quiet, 
oblivious, oddball kid.<br>
<br>
RUNAWAYS.<br>
<br>
Playing with long sentences does not mean ignoring basic rules. There is still 
no excuse for muddy thinking, ill-formed ideas, or flooding streams of 
consciousness. That's why we just went through all this sentence stuff. If you 
don't get the structural underpinnings of every sentence you craft, go back to 
simple subjects and predicates.<br>
<br>
A run-on sentence from the front page of the New York Times on May 26, 1998 
(months before Monicagate nixed everyone's best-laid plans), desperately needed 
an editor with a Day-Glo pen:<br>
<br>
Representative Robert L. Livingston supports Speaker Newt Gingrich as long as he 
wants to stay in the job, but when he leaves, Mr. Livingston knows who should be 
his replacement and that is the person Mr. Livingston faces in the mirror.<br>
<br>
That paragraph begins what's known in the newsroom as &quot;a teaser&quot;: it synopsizes 
a story appearing on an inside page. The problem is, the editor who summed up 
the story lacked the reporter's sentence know-how. Here's how the teaser should 
have been written:<br>
<br>
Representative Robert L. Livingston supports Newt Gingrich in the job of Speaker 
of the House. But when Mr. Gingrich leaves, the Louisiana congressman knows who 
should replace him: Robert L. Livingston.<br>
<br>
The president of the run-on must be George Bush, whose syntax slips were so bad 
that political correspondents tagged his weak rhetoric as &quot;Goofy mode&quot; (as in 
the Walt Disney character). Bush got Goofy one night in a Milwaukee suburb 
during the 1988 campaign. Telling the crowd how he had brought his two 
grandchildren to a Halloween rally the night before, Bush headed blithely down 
the slippery slope:<br>
<br>
We had last night, last night we had a couple of our grandchildren with us in 
Kansas City— 6-year-old twins, one of them went as a package of Juicy Fruit, 
arms sticking out of the pack, the other was Dracula. A big rally there.<br>
<br>
And Dracula's wig fell off in the middle of my speech and I got to thinking, 
watching those kids, and I said if I could look back and I had been president 
for four years: What would you like to do? Those young kids here. And I'd love 
to be able to say that working with our allies, working with the Soviets, I'd 
found a way to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
Maybe it seems unfair to poke fun at Bush for his off-the-cuff syntax, but his 
scripted speeches were often no better.<br>
<br>
TOWERS OF BABBLE.<br>
<br>
As if it weren't bad enough that the Ivory Tower gives us lugubrious nouns, 
ludicrous adjectives, and pompous prepositional pileups, think of the sentences 
churned out by academics. Philosophy and Literature, a journal published by the 
Johns Hopkins University Press, runs an annual contest for the ugliest, most 
stylistically awful sentence to come out of scholarly books and articles. 
Winners include untameable sentences like this one, by Stephen T. Tyman in The 
Philosophy of Paul Ricoeur:<br>
<br>
With the last gasp of Romanticism, the quelling of its florid uprising against 
the vapid formalism of one strain of the Enlightenment, the dimming of its 
yearning for the imagined grandeur of the archaic, and the dashing of its too 
sanguine hopes for a revitalised, fulfilled humanity, the horror of its more 
lasting, more Gothic legacy has settled in, distributed and diffused enough, to 
be sure, that lugubriousness is recognisable only as languor, or as a certain 
sardonic laconicism disguising itself in a new sanctification of the destructive 
instincts, a new genius for displacing cultural reifications in the interminable 
shell game of the analysis of the human psyche, where nothing remains sacred.<br>
<br>
That's not a stream of thought; it's a bunch of big words thrown into an 
Osterizer.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
It takes great writers to carry off sentences that seem to have no end. The 
chief wordsmith at Bonny Doon Vineyards, Randall Grahm, wrote a whopper for the 
label of a wine named Old Telegram:<br>
<br>
BROODING DEPTH YES MOUTHFUL LEGS YES DAZZLING BREADTH STAGGERING LENGTH YES 
SUBLIME ROBUST VIRILE UNCTUOUS HARMONIOUS COMPLETE YES POWERFUL FINISH GOES ON 
FOREVER YES DON'T STOP.<br>
<br>
The Bonny Doon run-on is not a Bush-league goof, but rather a spoof: the 
description parodies the stream-of-consciousness ending of Ulysses.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Ulysses, James Joyce's punctuationless paragraphs and endless 
sentences worked because of his superior command of cadence. Phrases and clauses 
did their work— even without commas— and words themselves (&quot;and,&quot; &quot;O,&quot; &quot;yes&quot;) 
became Joyce's punctuation. The Irish novelist's ear was impeccable; it's far 
easier to spoof him than to best him. So we'll let Joyce, in the ending of 
Ulysses, give us the last word on sentences:<br>
<br>
…and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene 
with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson 
sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda 
gardens yes and all the queer little streets and pink and blue and yellow houses 
and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar 
as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my 
hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed 
me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I 
asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say 
yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down 
to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like 
mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.<br>

<br>
Part 3<br>
<br>
Music<br>
When you get your grammar down, when you simplify your syntax, you are halfway 
to mastering the craft of writing. You have achieved what the critic Walter 
Pater called the &quot;radical merits&quot; of prose thought: &quot;order, precision, 
directness.&quot;<br>
<br>
But prose can be more than just ordered output. It can also be art, possessing 
all the qualities we associate with its more highfalutin cousin, poetry. Prose 
can have voice, lyricism, melody, and rhythm.<br>
<br>
But how do you get there?<br>
<br>
RELISH EVERY WORD.<br>
<br>
Appreciate music in prose, and develop your ear for it. Devour novels. Cue up 
recordings of famous speeches. Fall in love with poetry. Go to the video store 
and check out all those Shakespeare movies. Read your writing aloud.<br>
<br>
To paraphrase Ezra Pound slightly, don't imagine that the art of prose is any 
simpler than the art of music; spend as much time developing your craft as a 
pianist spends practicing scales. &quot;Let the neophyte know assonance and 
alliteration, rhyme immediate and delayed, simple and polyphonic, as a musician 
would expect to know harmony and counterpoint,&quot; Pound argued in his 1913 essay, 
&quot;A Few Don'ts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, cultivate catholic tastes. Expand your literary horizons. If you are a 
lawyer, loll about in the laconic images of Chinese poetry. If you are a 
novelist prone to the prolix, study the staccato sentences of David Mamet. If 
you are a lit teacher, take up Tom Clancy. If you write a newsletter for an 
accounting firm, read Salon. If you are an advertising copywriter, go for 
Gabriel García Márquez. Shake up your sensibilities. Discover the rut you're in, 
and climb out.<br>
<br>
Learn to love other tongues. &quot;Let the candidate fill his mind with the finest 
cadences he can discover, preferably in a foreign language,&quot; commanded Pound. 
&quot;Saxon charms, Hebridean Folk Songs, the verse of Dante, and the lyrics of 
Shakespeare…. Dissociate the vocabulary from the cadence…. Dissect the lyrics of 
Goethe coldly into their component sound values, syllables long and short, 
stressed and unstressed, into vowels and consonants.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sound a little highbrow? OK, then, listen to the nightly news on Univision, 
especially if no hablas español.<br>
<br>
BE SIMPLE, BUT GO DEEP.<br>
<br>
Every now and then, politicians become infatuated with &quot;Plain English.&quot; Granted, 
using simple words, short sentences, and a user-friendly conversational style 
has its merits. Plain English beats the tufts of fuzz many bureaucrats let 
loose. But, much as we deserve clarity from our public servants, we should hold 
our hired rhetoricians to a higher plane than &quot;plain.&quot;<br>
<br>
In his remarks closing the U.S. Senate's public hearings on the Iran-contra 
affair in 1987, Senator Daniel K. Inouye ventured beyond Plain English. His 
oratory wasn't merely simple, it was deep:<br>
<br>
In describing their motives for riding roughshod over the constitutional 
restraints built into our form of government, Admiral Poindexter and Lt. Col. 
North use almost the identical words. &quot;This is a dangerous world,&quot; they said. 
That, my fellow citizens, is an excuse for autocracy, not policy. Because no 
times were more dangerous than when our country was born, when revolution was 
our midwife. Our system of government has withstood the tests and tensions of 
civil conflict, the depression and two world wars, times hardly less challenging 
than our own present. Indeed, as our greatest military leaders, such as 
Washington, Marshall, and Eisenhower, have recognized, our form of government is 
what gives us strength. It must be safeguarded, particularly when times are 
dangerous and the temptation to arrogant power is the greatest. Vigilance abroad 
does not require us to abandon our ideas of rule of law at home. On the 
contrary, without our principles and without our ideals we have little that is 
special or worthy to defend.<br>
<br>
With an eloquence to suit the occasion, Inouye did not shrink from polysyllables 
(restraints, autocracy, safeguarded, temptation, arrogant, vigilance), nor did 
he keep his sentences short. (He did, however, stick to straight syntax.) But 
what elevates Inouye's speech is its music: the sounds of the words (&quot;autocracy, 
not policy,&quot; &quot;tests and tensions&quot;), the imagery (&quot;revolution was our midwife&quot;), 
and the cadences (&quot;Vigilance abroad does not require us to abandon our ideas of 
rule of law at home&quot;).<br>
<br>
When occasions call for eloquence, you need poetry, not Plain English.<br>
<br>
TAKE RISKS.<br>
<br>
Language offers us a surprising, savage terrain full of pockets and peaks. 
Despite this, English teachers still hew to Standard Written English as some 
vague paragon of virtue. Don't hew, too.<br>
<br>
Eschew the standard. Americans have always inclined, wrote H. L. Mencken, 
&quot;toward a directness of statement which, at its greatest, lacks restraint and 
urbanity altogether, and toward a hospitality which often admits novelties for 
the mere sake of their novelty, and is quite uncritical of the difference 
between a genuine improvement in succinctness and clarity, and mere extravagant 
raciness.&quot; Maybe being &quot;quite uncritical&quot; is a little too lax, but what's wrong 
with appreciating &quot;extravagant raciness&quot;?<br>
<br>
Extravagant raciness isn't only the province of American English. David 
Dabydeen, a prize-winning British poet, writes verse in what he calls the 
&quot;angry, crude, energetic&quot; creole of his native West Indies. In an essay titled 
&quot;On Not Being Milton: Nigger Talk in England Today,&quot; Dabydeen argues that 
contemporary English poetry is afflicted with &quot;the disease of gentility.&quot; 
Dabydeen champions the work of poets like John Agard, whose &quot;Listen Mr. Oxford 
Don&quot; thumbs its nose at the very notion of &quot;correct&quot; English:<br>
<br>
Dem accuse me of assault<br>
<br>
on de Oxford dictionary/…<br>
<br>
I slashing suffix in self-defense<br>
<br>
I bashing future with present tense<br>
<br>
and if necessary<br>
<br>
I making de Queen's English accessory / to my offence<br>
<br>
The patois of British blacks, Dabydeen writes, is like Caliban &quot;tearing up the 
pages of Prospero's magic book and repasting it in his own order, by his own 
method, and for his own purpose.&quot; And what a purpose it is.<br>
<br>
Whether West Indian creole, the idioms of the Deep South, or Lake Wobegonics, 
nonstandard English remembers the strong link between the spoken and the 
written, a link getting even stronger in this age of email. Slang, vernacular, 
the colloquial— all have a place in literary writing. Without abandoning prose 
with a capital P, we can build the musicality of our writing by listening to the 
street.<br>
<br>
Don't settle for the safe. Find language that conjures up fresh images and lets 
its cadences rise and fall and refuse to go flat.<br>
<br>
SEEK BEAUTY.<br>
<br>
Some language types mistakenly diss our mother tongue, calling it less musical 
than those exotic languages— Italian, perhaps, or Tahitian— that drip with 
mellifluous vowels. But English, rooted in an Anglo-Saxon full of crisp 
consonants and punchy words, makes its own kind of music.<br>

The Spanish-born, Paris- and Oxford-educated writer Salvador de Madariaga waxed 
ecstatic about the beauty and &quot;fidelity&quot; of English words in 1928: &quot;They are 
marvellous, those English monosyllables. Their fidelity is so perfect that one 
is tempted to think English words are the right and proper names which acts are 
meant to have, and all other words are pitiable failures. How could one improve 
upon splash, smash, ooze, shriek, slush, glide, squeak, coo? Is not the word 
sweet a kiss in itself, and what could suggest a more peremptory obstacle than 
stop?&quot;<br>
<br>
If you want to wallow, like de Madariaga, in the simple beauty of English, pick 
up the book of Psalms and read them out loud. Memorize the Gettysburg Address 
and linger on the speeches in the anthology Lend Me Your Ears. Refresh yourself 
with some Walt Whitman, some Zora Neale Hurston, some William Carlos Williams. 
Or listen to the lyrics of Cole Porter.<br>
<br>
FIND THE RIGHT PITCH.<br>
<br>
There is a story of a super-respectful official of the Raj who found his British 
superior laboriously correcting a letter he had written to a fellow Indian: 
&quot;Your honour puts yourself to much trouble correcting my English and doubtless 
the final letter will be much better literature,&quot; the corrected one commented. 
&quot;But it will go from me Mukherji to him Bannerji, and he Bannerji will 
understand it a great deal better as I Mukherji write it than as your honour 
corrects it.&quot;<br>
<br>
He, Mukherji, got it— better than his boss: Voice gives writing validity.<br>
<br>
And voice is especially valuable in an era when information trumps insight, 
where the flow of data exceeds our capacity to distill— to make it ours and to 
make it matter. The word processor, the copier, the optical scanner, the fax— 
all these machines make it easy to spew words without choosing them carefully.<br>
<br>
In a world of TV anchors who deliver the news in banal and accentless bursts, at 
a time when &quot;branding&quot; beats originality and when you can't escape mindless— and 
endless— &quot;Just Do It&quot; commercials, we urgently long for writing that is 
original, passionate, and personal. We search for writers whose voices are 
distinct and recognizable. We celebrate prose that is musical.<br>

Voice<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
Voice is the je ne sais quoi of spirited writing. It separates brochures and 
brilliance, memo and memoir, a ship's log and The Old Man and the Sea. The best 
writers stamp prose with their own distinctive personality; their timbre and 
tone are as recognizable as their voices on the phone. To cultivate voice, you 
must listen for the music of language— the vernacular, the syntactic tics, the 
cadences.<br>
<br>
Strong voice is conversational: The writer leaves us with a sense that we are 
listening to a skilled raconteur rather than passing our eyes over ink on paper. 
This involves more than just following the simplistic command &quot;Write the way you 
talk&quot;: voice involves more than accurate transcription. The true zing of 
conversation comes from attentive listening and painstaking revision.<br>
<br>
Conversation was the critical element in Robert Frost's poetry, and it formed 
the basis of a theory of language he applied to both poetry and prose. Frost 
scholar Peter J. Stanlis remarks that for the New England poet, good writing was 
synonymous with good conversation. &quot;I was after poetry that talked,&quot; Frost once 
said. An essay by Stanlis in Modern Age quarterly describes the evolution of 
Frost's effort to convert colloquial speech into art and the poet's belief that 
language allows a &quot;correspondence&quot; between writer and reader. Stanlis quotes 
Frost:<br>
<br>
If my poems were talking poems— if to read them you heard a voice— that would be 
to my liking!… Whenever I write a line it is because that line has already been 
spoken clearly by a voice within my mind, an audible voice.<br>
<br>
I have unconsciously tried to do just what Chaucer did when the language was 
young and untried and virile. I have sought only those words I had met up with 
as a boy in New Hampshire, working on farms during the summer vacations. I 
listened to the men with whom I worked…. When I started to carry their 
conversation over into poetry, I could hear their voices, and the sound posture 
differentiated between one and the other.<br>
<br>
Prose stylists need to listen for that &quot;audible voice&quot; within. It gives prose 
strength, the sense of a person speaking naturally. But a real person, not a 
type or stereotype. Strong voice comes when contemporary writers play with the 
full palette available to them: literary English (formally correct, rich in 
vocabulary, complex in sentence structure, and, at its best, flowing with 
stately grace); conversational English (ranging from high-minded palaver to 
lowbrow banter); jargon (the professional patois of doctors, lawyers, and 
corporate chiefs); and colloquial, idiomatic English (the language of the 
street, whether Spanglish, Pidgin English, or Valley Girl chat).<br>
<br>
Prose with a strong voice might reflect a narrator or central characters who are 
colorful. The voice of Limerick-born Frank McCourt comes to mind. His memoir, 
Angela's Ashes, brims with Irish authenticity:<br>
<br>
&#65532;Ode to a tape recorder.<br>
<br>
There may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage 
to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the 
morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never 
smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, 
and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you 
with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot 
your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in 
their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big 
enough for a sparrow to raise a family.<br>
<br>
Frank McCourt's strong voice is rooted in vocabulary true to his characters 
(fags, 'tis, gob) and in his ability to recapture the metaphors that spring from 
his father's lips as easily as songs about dying for Ireland.<br>
<br>
At its most risky, voice swings, it swears, it swivels at the hip. But it can't 
be co-opted cavalierly. It must be true, appropriate. Every time you write, you 
are having a conversation with a silent partner, your reader. Respect this 
reader. You want to entice your audience into conversations, rather than 
shutting them out.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
&quot;The pen must at length comply with the tongue,&quot; Samuel Johnson wrote in the 
preface to his dictionary, and among the writers of his time who mastered the 
art of unaffected conversation were the poet John Dryden and the parodist 
Jonathan Swift. Across the Atlantic and into the next century, the literary 
evangelist Walt Whitman was bent on developing a truly American voice, 
reflecting &quot;the liberties and the brawn of These States.&quot; But it took Mark Twain 
to really limn the rhythms and vocabulary of American English, to write prose 
that was at once literary and colloquial. (T. S. Eliot ranked Twain with Dryden 
and Swift as &quot;one of those rare writers who have brought their language up to 
date, and in so doing, 'purified the dialect of the tribe.'&nbsp;&quot;)<br>
<br>
In Huckleberry Finn, Twain zestily explored the new American vernacular, using 
what he called &quot;the Missouri Negro dialect, the extremist form of the backwoods 
Southwestern dialect, the ordinary 'Pike County' dialect, and four modified 
varieties of this last.&quot; Elsewhere, Twain dabbled in &quot;Injun-English,&quot; the slang 
of prospectors in California and Nevada, as well as &quot;the vigorous new vernacular 
of the occidental plains and mountains.&quot; Here's a sample, from &quot;The Celebrated 
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&quot;:<br>
<br>
Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tomcats, and all 
them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for 
him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, 
and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three 
months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he 
did learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute 
you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut— see him turn one 
summerset, or maybe a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed 
and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and 
kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he 
could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 
'most anything— and I believe him.<br>
<br>
Writing does not have to be fiction to be full of voice. Nor does the writer 
have to be as flamboyant as Mark Twain. In fact, some of the strongest prose 
stylists of this century— E. B. White, James Thurber, Lewis Thomas— write in 
such understated voices that their work seems downright uncrafted. Now that's 
illusion of the highest order. Writing in a natural conversational voice takes 
some serious work.<br>
<br>

<br>
EMAIL— THAT NEW LITERARY FORM— brims with voice. A cross between speaking and 
writing, it involves informal, conversational communication spiced by immediacy 
and urgency. Partly because it's not face to face, partly because we use it in a 
spontaneous way, email is closer to phone conversations than to sober memos and 
magazine articles. It is chatty, colloquial, intimate. It is composed not in 
long hours of reflection and revision but in blunt bursts and on-the-fly 
fragments. Since the &quot;rules&quot; of writing never took hold in cyberspace, email 
tends to the raw, the typo-laden, the impassioned, and the unpolished.<br>
<br>
The best online prose, like the best email, is unpretentious, personal, and full 
of voice. When Phil Agre, the publisher of Red Rock Eater, asked members of his 
mailing list to describe their immediate physical surroundings, he elicited a 
series of vignettes that were published online under the heading &quot;Where I Sit.&quot; 
The following two posts, from John Farrell— co-author of Managers as 
Facilitators &lt;www.facilitator.org&gt;— and Sara Miles, a writer living in San 
Francisco, convey a clear sense of the person before the screen.<br>

I lease office space in a beautiful old building in downtown Minneapolis. I can 
see Nicollet Mall from my second-story office window. Pictures of my family are 
scattered throughout my office. My little girl's artwork covers part of two 
walls. My computer sits on the skinny part of the &quot;L&quot; on my desk. There are two 
large &quot;flip-chart&quot; papers covered with the outline of a course (in black, blue, 
green and red marker) I and a colleague are teaching later this week. My desk is 
covered with papers and my &quot;project box&quot; is stuffed full of work to be done for 
various clients.<br>
<br>
I have four unopened &quot;TRY AMERICA ONLINE FREE!&quot; diskette packages sitting on my 
little computer speakers. I think I'll throw them away.<br>
<br>
There, that feels better.<br>

I work in a big, sunlit room the color of roses. On the walls are pressed 
flowers my great-great-grandfather, a Transcendentalist, picked a hundred years 
ago and labelled in his spidery hand: &quot;Convovolus Sepium, Hedge Bindweed, June 
19, '86.&quot; On my desk are piles of paper from current projects: the manuscript of 
an anthology I'm editing on gay and lesbian sexual cultures for NYU Press; a 
piece I'm writing for HotWired on interactive gaming; an essay on electronic 
cash, and a manuscript about the prophetic tradition in law. There's an old 
White House press pass on a metal chain that my daughter's been playing with, a 
story I clipped from the business section of the New York Times, a gorgeous 
photo of my girlfriend laughing, six pens, two pencils, a pair of scissors, and 
a PowerBook165 with the slowest modem in the world. My windows look out on the 
Cesar Chavez Elementary School, a bright blue building covered in murals; 
there's a sign in Spanish taped to the front door directing!! parents to the 
Wednesday night computer class. I can see the drug dealer from down the block 
walking his Rottweiler, Mrs. Mayzyk sweeping her stairs, and the guys on the 
corner fixing their car. It's not that I don't care about the future, but the 
tangle of many pasts and the gravity and beauty of the undeniable present tend 
to focus my attention at this desk.<br>

John Farrell's description is straightforward and simple, but it is far from 
static. When he thinks out loud— or, rather, online— &quot;I'll think I'll throw them 
away,&quot; and then in the next beat says &quot;There, that feels better,&quot; we feel as 
though we are sitting next to him, in real time. That's voice! Our strong sense 
of Miles comes partly through the detail she gives us, about her 
Transcendentalist grandfather, her girlfriend laughing, and Mrs. Mayzyk sweeping 
her stairs. But it also comes through the immediacy of I, the rhythm of the 
telling, the inclusion of the double!!s.<br>

FICTION WRITERS - AND A FEW skillful journalists— go beyond just &quot;writing as 
they talk,&quot; peppering their prose with the voices of their characters. Among the 
young contemporary prose stylists who play with the poetry of nonstandard 
English is Junot Díaz, who shifts from the barrios of the Caribbean to the New 
Jersey 'hood. Díaz, born in the Dominican Republic, plies his own brand of 
language in short stories like &quot;The Sun, the Moon, the Stars&quot;:<br>
<br>
I don't even want to tell you where we're at. We're in Casa de Campo. The Resort 
That Shame Forgot. The average asshole would love this place. It's the largest, 
wealthiest resort on the Island, which means it's a goddam fortress, walled away 
from everybody else. Guachimanes and peacocks and ambitious topiaries 
everywhere. Advertises itself in the States as its own country, and it might as 
well be. Has its own airport, thirty-six holes of golf, beaches so white they 
ache to be trampled, and the only Island Dominicans you're guaranteed to see are 
either caked up or changing your sheets. Let's just say my abuelo has never been 
here, and neither has yours. This is where the Garcías and the Colóns come to 
relax after a long month of oppressing the masses, where the tutumpotes can 
trade tips with their colleagues from abroad. Chill here too long and you'll be 
sure to have your ghetto pass revoked, no questions asked….<br>
<br>
The sun is blazing and the blue of the ocean is an overload on the brain. Casa 
de Campo has got beaches the way the rest of the island has problems. These, 
though, have no merengue, no little kids, nobody trying to sell you 
chicharrones, and there's a massive melanin deficit in evidence. Every fifty 
feet there's at least one Eurofuck beached out on a towel like some scary pale 
monster that the sea's vomited up. They look like philosophy professors, like 
budget Foucaults, and too many of them are in the company of a dark-assed 
Dominican girl. I mean it, these girls can't be no more than sixteen, look puro 
ingenio to me. You can tell by their inability to communicate that these two 
didn't meet back in their Left Bank days.<br>
<br>
Díaz's startling narrative voice emerges first out of vocabulary that embraces 
Spanish words (tutumpotes) and slang (caked up and Chill here) and profane 
inventions (Eurofuck). It also plays with sentence fragments (&quot;The Resort That 
Shame Forgot&quot;) and sorry syntax (&quot;these girls can't be no more than sixteen&quot;) to 
reflect the way characters really talk. Díaz also adopts an informal point of 
view (&quot;Let's just say my abuelo has never been here, and neither has yours&quot;) and 
gets in some highbrow-lowbrow disses (&quot;beaches so white they ache to be 
trampled&quot; and &quot;They look like philosophy professors, like budget Foucaults&quot;). 
Sum total: distinctive voice.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
WRITING OFF KEY.<br>
<br>
Using the wrong voice and tone for the occasion and the audience is a cardinal 
sin. &quot;Choosing a tone requires tact,&quot; write the poet Donald Hall and the critic 
Sven Birkerts in Writing Well. &quot;Audience determines tone; tone is the writer's 
choice of a connection with the reader. The doctor delivering a paper to his 
colleagues writes a formal and scientifically exact prose; the same person, 
contributing to an alumni newsletter, writes a relaxed and conversational 
prose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Formal, though, does not have to mean stiff. A formal tone— often created by too 
much puffed-up vocabulary— can be off-putting. Watch for too many nouns ending 
in -tion, too many verbs ending in -ize, too many adjectives ending in -wide. 
(Go back to chapters 1­8 for a refresher on which words to avoid.) Stay away 
from nonsense pileups of nouns (&quot;interactive facilitated sessions with direct 
feedback and reinforcement materials&quot;) or cadences that, instead of rolling 
along, bump and grind like an avalanche of concrete blocks (&quot;we have nonviolent 
and nonage-identified behavior issues&quot;).<br>
<br>
Stiff, overly formal, voiceless prose is so endemic in academia that some 
professors make a sport out of lampooning each other's excesses. The judges of 
an academics'&nbsp;&quot;Bad Writing&quot; contest sponsored by the journal Philosophy and 
Literature declared Fredric Jameson a &quot;winner&quot;: they said reading the comp lit 
professor's own lit was like &quot;swimming through cold porridge.&quot; The Duke 
University doc does have a respectable academic following, the judges noted, but 
check out the voiceless mouthful that opens his Signatures of the Visible:<br>
<br>
The visual is essentially pornographic, which is to say that it has its end in 
rapt, mindless fascination; thinking about its attributes becomes an adjunct to 
that, if it is unwilling to betray its object; while the most austere films 
necessarily draw their energy from the attempt to repress their own excess 
(rather than from the more thankless effort to discipline the viewer).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, too many students adopt the style of their professors. Even when 
formality is appropriate, don't drone like a robot. In a cover letter for a job, 
be polite, but remember it's you an employer wants to know about, not a 
boilerplate applicant. Be yourself. Whether you're crafting résumés or 
reportage, try mixing formal and informal diction. Go for an occasional 
surprise.<br>
<br>
THE FALSE FIRST PERSON.<br>
<br>
Some novice writers mistake the first-person pronoun I for voice. While personal 
narrative does usually rely on strong voice for success, not all narratives need 
be personal, and many become muddied by the ill-considered use of the first 
person. Some writing is way too up-close-and-personal for its own good.<br>
<br>
In &quot;Africa Rising,&quot; a report on that continent that ran in Wired magazine, the 
word I appears 235 times, the word Africa a mere 78. John Perry Barlow's 
&quot;report&quot; is too too solipsistic— it is more about him than about Africa:<br>
<br>
I am not ready. Indeed, I am afraid, and fear is not a common affliction of 
mine. I'm not afraid of being killed, nor of any of the projected African perils 
that have my loved ones so spooked. I figure their horrific images are mostly 
mediamagoria. I think I'm afraid of becoming someone else, which is, I suppose, 
a sort of death. I feel as if I am setting out on quest for the next version of 
myself, much as I did nine years ago when I closed down my first life and went 
venturing off to Silicon Valley. Now I'm due for a new mission, but it's an 
odyssey I don't know how to prepare for. The line between self-expression and 
self-indulgence can be hard to discern. Test every temptation to use I, and try 
other devices if you care about voice.<br>
<br>
PHONEY TONES.<br>
<br>
In Simple and Direct, Jacques Barzun describes what he calls the 
&quot;pseudo-Hemingway&quot; tone: writing that creates an impression of headlong speed 
punctuated by frequent shocks, full of fragments and crime-story clichés. One 
student of Barzun's nailed the &quot;pseudo-Hemingway&quot; tone in this parody:<br>
<br>
I saw her first. She was tall, blond. She looked good. She smiled. I stepped 
back. She came up close. She smelled good. She put her arms around me. I kissed 
her. She raised an eyebrow. I nodded. We were engaged.<br>
<br>
Remember, &quot;being earnest&quot; does not mean mimicking Hemingway.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
If the writer is skilled enough, voice captures the syntax and spirit of the 
subject. Whether in fiction or nonfiction, the narrator can take on the 
personality of the characters. Such play-acting was one of the major innovations 
of the New Journalism. Tom Wolfe, in his 1973 essay on that movement, wrote 
about writers picking up voice as a defense against &quot;a century-old British 
tradition in which it was understood that the narrator shall assume a calm, 
cultivated and, in fact, genteel voice. The idea was that the narrator's own 
voice should be like the off-white or putty-colored walls that Syrie Maugham 
popularized in interior decoration… a 'neutral background' against which bits of 
color would stand out…. By the early 1960s understatement had become an absolute 
pall.&quot; Continuing, Wolfe wrote that that pale beige tone became a signal to 
readers &quot;that a well-known bore was here again, 'the journalist,' a pedestrian 
mind, a phlegmatic spirit, a faded personality, and there was no way to get rid 
of the pallid little troll, short of ceasing to read.&quot;<br>
<br>
So Wolfe et alia ditched Standard Written English. In a story about Junior 
Johnson, a stock-car racer from Ingle Hollow, North Carolina, who learned to 
drive by running moonshine whiskey, Wolfe adopts Johnson's Ingle Hollow lingo:<br>
<br>
Working mash wouldn't wait for a man. It started coming to a head when it got 
ready to and a man had to be there to take it off, out there in the woods, in 
the brush, in the brambles, in the muck, in the snow. Wouldn't it have been 
something if you could have just set it all up inside a good old shed with a 
corrugated metal roof and order those parts like you want them and not have to 
smuggle all that copper and all that sugar and all that everything out here in 
the woods and be a coppersmith and a plumber and a cooper and a carpenter and a 
pack horse and every other goddamned thing God ever saw in the world, all at 
once. And live decent hours….<br>
<br>
It's not just literary journalists who want to be hip to voice. Bonny Doon 
Vineyards elevates PR to pure wit by parodying the voice of academia. For a wine 
called &quot;Critique of Pure Riesling,&quot; the copy on the wine label reflects the 
pompous, inflated style of philosophical drivel:<br>
<br>
Kant? Or won't? The philosophical imbiber asks himself, &quot;What ought I to consume 
with Asian cuisine, with charcuterie or while simply enjoying a moment of repose 
and reflection?&quot; One might argue categorically the imperative of experiencing 
this potation directly, as a wein-an-sich, eschewing any a priori conception of 
the wine's wineness whilst remaining particularly vigilant of the dominant and 
pernicious, transcendental chardocentric paradigm. Harvested omnino from the 
vintage MCMXCVI, this dry Riesling represents the summun bonum of impeccable 
vineyards in the great state of Washington.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;CHAPTER 14&#65532;<br>
<br>
Lyricism<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
The lyre— the small harp of the ancient Greeks— haunts the term lyricism, 
harking back to the days when narratives were accompanied by strings. And today, 
the ultimate &quot;lyrical&quot; writing still happens when poets put words to song.<br>
<br>
The best Country Western lyricists, like Hank Williams, use words to mainline 
emotions like lust, love, and lonesomeness:<br>
<br>
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill<br>
He sounds too blue to fly<br>
The midnight train is whining low<br>
I'm so lonesome I could cry<br>
<br>
Did you ever see the night so long<br>
When time goes crawling by<br>
The moon just went behind a cloud<br>
To hide her face and cry<br>
<br>
Williams's lyricism springs mostly from vivid descriptions that work on our 
reservoir of feelings and associations. In the first stanza, he does it through 
adjectives and imagery: the lonesome whippoorwill, the midnight train. In the 
second he relies on metaphor, turning Time into a crawling animal. He endows the 
whippoorwill and the moon with human feelings, just in case we don't make the 
connections.<br>
<br>
Prose can be as lyrical as Country Western croons, if you work your words so 
that they convey deep emotions and direct thoughts. Let your imagination leap 
and your words sing. Lyricism springs from connotation, imagery, and metaphor:<br>
<br>
• Connotation seeks felicitous words with layers of meaning and resonances 
beyond the concrete. One reason many Christians cling sentimentally to the King 
James Bible is the poetry in its words. In phrases like &quot;Neither cast ye your 
pearls before swine&quot; the words have connotations that were lost in the New 
English Bible of 1961, with its &quot;Do not feed your pearls to pigs.&quot; &quot;Feed&quot; in the 
modern version cannot even imagine the nuances of &quot;cast,&quot; and &quot;pig&quot; trades the 
suggestion of evil and moral depravity of &quot;swine&quot; for the generic term for the 
barnyard animal.<br>
<br>
• Imagery taps deep feelings through visual descriptions. Images are our link to 
memory, to the imagination, to the collective unconscious. Hank Williams's moon 
slipping behind a cloud is an image every listener recognizes. When M.F.K. 
Fisher describes a person as a &quot;trembling daffodil,&quot; she uses imagery to convey 
psychology.<br>
<br>
• Metaphor— the comparison of disparate things— surprises us, revealing deeper 
truths and providing unexpected insights. (We are using metaphor as a catchall 
term including simile, symbol, and analogy.)<br>
<br>
When William Finnegan describes the February surf at Ocean Beach, he uses 
metaphor: &quot;The first wall of sandy, grumbling white water felt like a barrel of 
gritty ice cubes poured down my back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Metaphor might also be expressed more implicitly. Finnegan calls offshore winds, 
those that blow from land to sea, &quot;the wonder drug of surfing&quot; and compares them 
to a &quot;sculptor's blade&quot;:<br>
<br>
Because they cross so little water before they reach the waves, they create no 
troublesome chop, and because they strike the waves from the front they don't 
force the waves to topple prematurely and haphazardly, the way onshores do, 
letting the power of a wave rise, gather, and concentrate in the crest before it 
can overcome the wind's resistance…. The sum effect of offshore winds is greater 
than any of its parts. On a good day, their sculptor's blade, meticulous and 
invisible, seems to drench whole coastlines in grace.<br>
<br>
Finnegan doesn't need metaphor to precisely describe the effect of offshore 
winds; he needs it to put us there, on the beach. To give us a visceral 
response— the rush of seeing the whole coastline drenched in grace.<br>
<br>
&#65532;More on metaphor.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
In prose, a single word is often enough to kick imagery and metaphor into gear. 
When a reporter slips an image into a lede, he or she takes the story beyond the 
Who What When Where, into the How and the Why. In 1989, J. Michael Kennedy and 
Bob Baker conveyed the drama and horror of a plane crash near Sioux City through 
vivid imagery:<br>
<br>
A crippled United Airlines DC-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway while 
trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday afternoon, bursting into a 
cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as &quot;15,000 
pieces.&quot;<br>
<br>
That &quot;cartwheeling fireball,&quot; together with the snapshot of &quot;15,000 pieces,&quot; 
made the L.A. Times opening stand out from the hundreds of ledes printed across 
the country about the disaster in an Iowa cornfield.<br>
<br>
Metaphor might also be a swift phrase or a deft stroke that zeroes in on a 
character or a subject. Novelist James Salter used &quot;the silence of a folded 
flag&quot; to describe the quiet of an afternoon in provincial France. Newsweek's 
Jack Kroll, in praising the film 1984, added that the director &quot;found a new 
color spectrum, the bleached-out rainbow of hopelessness.&quot; Henry Louis Gates, 
Jr., used a knot of comparisons to convey basketball legend Michael Jordan as an 
archetype: &quot;The man is both hulking and suave, and it's easy to see why he has 
become a totem of black masculinity; he makes Bill Cosby look like Uncle Ben.&quot; 
Later in the same New Yorker profile, Gates gives an account of Jordan's 
contentious contract negotiations with Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry 
Reinsdorf: &quot;Jordan, considered strictly as an athlete, is the Second Coming, and 
Reinsdorf, considered strictly as a mogul, is a second-rater. It's as if Pat 
Robertson were making Jesus punch a time card.&quot;<br>

LYRICAL WRITING, LIKE ALL WRITING, still depends on concrete images and strong 
detail. But the occasional metaphor makes descriptive passages sail, as in this 
opening of a spring essay by Ian Frazier called &quot;Stuck in Trees&quot;:<br>
<br>
This is the season of plastic bags stuck in trees. Stray shopping bags— many of 
them white, with handles, perhaps from a deli or a fruit-and-vegetable store 
originally— roll along the streets, fill with air, levitate like disembodied 
undershirts, fly, snag by their handles in the branches. Trees wave them in the 
breeze. They luff and whirr like spinnakers and twist into knots. Daniel, a guy 
who works at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, was removing a plastic bag from a 
Japanese flowering cherry tree at the Eastern Parkway entrance with a leaf rake 
as I walked by. He held the rake above him at arm's length and snatched at the 
bag with the tines. It took him a while; finally, he pulled the bag down and 
squashed it into a ball in his hand. I asked if I could see it. Its blue logo 
read, &quot;MARTIN PAINT… 'It Ain't Just Paint.'&nbsp;&quot;<br>
<br>
Frazier turns litter into kites and spinnakers and spectres. And he does his 
metaphor just right: he keeps his similes simple and ties them to concrete 
images and literal language. Don't overdo it.<br>
<br>
Virginia Woolf casts an exquisite metaphor in her essay &quot;A Room of One's Own.&quot; 
Based upon two papers that Woolf read to the Arts Society at Newnham and the 
Odtaa at Girton, the 1928 essay addressed the complicated issue of &quot;women and 
fiction.&quot; Woolf writes that she &quot;sat down on the banks of a river and began to 
wonder what the words meant&quot;:<br>
<br>
Here I was then… sitting on the banks of a river a week or two ago in fine 
October weather, lost in thought…. To the right and left bushes of some sort, 
golden and crimson, glowed with the colour, even it seemed burnt with the heat, 
of fire. On the further bank the willows wept in perpetual lamentation, their 
hair about their shoulders. The river reflected whatever it chose of sky and 
bridge and burning tree, and when the undergraduate had oared his boat through 
the reflections they closed again, completely, as if he had never been. There 
one might have sat the clock round lost in thought. Thought— to call it by a 
prouder name than it deserved— had let its line down into the stream. It swayed 
minute after minute, hither and thither among the reflections and the weeds, 
letting the water lift it and sink it, until— you know the little tug— the 
sudden conglomeration of an idea at the end of one's line: and then the cautious 
hauling of it in, and the careful laying of it out. Alas, laid on the grass how 
small, how insignificant this thought of mine looked; the sort of fish that a 
good fisherman puts back into the water so that it may grow fatter and be one 
day worth cooking and eating.<br>
<br>
Woolf extends her metaphor: an idea begins as a fish gently tugging at the end 
of the line, then becomes prey— something with which the thinker toys— then 
shifts yet again— to a disappointment, or perhaps a promise of fatter fish to 
come.<br>
<br>
Vladimir Nabokov, too, was a master of applying poetic devices in prose. In 
Pnin, he lets loose a brilliant metaphor in a paragraph in which a middle-aged 
professor returns from the dentist, contemplating the psychological effect of a 
new set of dentures:<br>
<br>
A warm flow of pain was gradually replacing the ice and wood of the anesthetic 
in his thawing, still half-dead, abominably martyred mouth. After that, during a 
few days he was in mourning for an intimate part of himself. It surprised him to 
realize how fond he had been of his teeth. His tongue, a fat sleek seal, used to 
flop and slide so happily among the familiar rocks, checking the contours of a 
battered but still secure kingdom, plunging from cave to cove, climbing this 
jag, puzzling that notch, finding a shred of sweet seaweed in the same old 
cleft; but now not a landmark remained, and all there existed was a great dark 
wound, a terra incognita of gums which dread and disgust forbade one to 
investigate. And when the plates were thrust in, it was like a poor fossil skull 
being fitted with the grinning jaws of a perfect stranger.<br>
<br>
It takes true imagination to turn a tongue into a fat sleek seal on the familiar 
rocks.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
TIN-EAR-ICAL.<br>
<br>
Sometimes writers stretching for the lyrical founder on infelicities. They may 
come up with combinations that just don't jibe, like a description of a 
cybergang member whose eyes were &quot;black as blueberries.&quot; (Since when are 
blueberries black?) When it comes to bad metaphors, the eyes have it. David 
Mamet in Make Believe Town, mocks screenwriters who gush, &quot;she has a pair of 
eyes that makes you think of olives in a plate of milk.&quot; Bet you wouldn't want 
to taste a combo of olives and milk. Who would want to behold it?<br>
<br>
Sometimes writers paste adjectives onto metaphors without thinking through the 
concomitant image. Stop and use some brain cells before resorting to a phrase 
like &quot;the biggest bottleneck.&quot; How can a bottleneck be gaping? &quot;Most 
troublesome,&quot; maybe. A media critic once described Microsoft's excitable chief 
technology officer Nathan Myhrvold as &quot;speaking at the hypertext speed of the 
information revolution.&quot; Hypertext speed? Since when is hypertext— a system of 
coding text that links electronic documents with each other— speedy? A music 
critic for the Wilmington News Journal once heralded &quot;the synergistic 
combination of the European style with the Russian melodic fertilizer which 
Tchaikovsky managed to spread across the orchestral field.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now that's a tin ear.<br>
<br>
DEAD METAPHORS.<br>
<br>
Metaphors must be original, invented by the writer for the story at hand. A 
metaphor has the shelf life of a fresh vegetable. Too many of the metaphors in 
print are worn out, used up, hackneyed, empty. (Sorry for the redundancy, but, 
really.) George Orwell railed against dead metaphors like toe the line, ride 
roughshod over, the hammer and the anvil, and no axe to grind, pointing out that 
these are used unthinkingly by writers ignorant of the original vivid meaning. 
Such ignorance leads to common editing errors like &quot;tow the line,&quot; which appears 
as often in print as the correct metaphor, refering to the athlete's practice of 
standing at the starting line before a race. Similarly, writers often imply that 
the anvil gets the worst of it, while, as Orwell scolds, &quot;in real life it is 
always the anvil that breaks the hammer.&quot; A Silicon Valley venture capitalist 
once bragged about a partnership with a Parisian bank that &quot;provides us with a 
European beachfront to help our US companies establish overseas partners.&quot; That 
guy needs a trip out of Silicon Valley— to Normandy?— to learn the difference 
between beachfront and beachhead.<br>
<br>
Related to dead metaphors are clichés, combinations of words repeated so often 
in the same shape as to lose their force. Don't use combinations you have heard 
before. Leave no stone unturned was probably once a vivid way to describe 
painstaking effort, but now it seems limp and unimaginative. Beware of combos 
you can complete without thinking: loud and clear, hue and cry, gild the lily, 
at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
And don't forget that buried in many a cliché is a metaphor. When a woman in 
Ireland came to President Clinton's defense in 1998, she argued: &quot;If everybody's 
washing were hung out, there would be skeletons in all their closets.&quot; Think 
about that one.<br>
<br>
MIXED METAPHORS.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, in an attempt to be &quot;creative&quot; or to make prose more &quot;exciting,&quot; 
writers confuse metaphors, as did the Irishwoman just quoted. The result is no 
more intelligible than scrambled radio signals.<br>
<br>
When Boyle Roche, a member of the British Parliament in the nineteenth century, 
said, &quot;Mr. Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him floating in the air; I hear him 
rustling in the breeze, but I shall nip him in the bud,&quot; he turned a rat into a 
bird into a broad leaf into a rose. Mixed Metaphor City.<br>
<br>
A century later, Donald Nixon mangled an attempt to spin his brother's Watergate 
troubles: &quot;It is unfortunate that it happened, but people are using it as a 
political football to bury my brother.&quot; How can a football dig a grave?<br>
<br>
Ever on the lookout, the New Yorker collects slips of the pen from reputable 
newspapers all over the country, reprinting them under the heading &quot;Block That 
Metaphor.&quot; Here are some picks:<br>
<br>
It was an irresistible example of how public money and engineering genius could 
bring water to fire the engine of growth.<br>
<br>
Like a giant sheet of carbon paper, South Florida spreads its familiar arms from 
baseball camp to baseball camp, catching time in a bottle and wrapping the Boys 
of Springtime in a velvet glove of comfortable déjà vu.<br>
<br>
It was a battle to wrestle control of our classrooms away from the stranglehold 
of our current discipline system that allows students to fall into the ravine of 
failure by the thousands and knock over their peers along the way, like an 
endless, winding game of dominoes.<br>
<br>
Don't let mixed metaphors get a stranglehold on you.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Lyricism doesn't have to be lofty: it can also be lowbrow. And funny. Politics 
has given us some metaphorical howls: Teddy Roosevelt accused his predecessor, 
William McKinley, of showing &quot;all the backbone of a chocolate eclair,&quot; while 
Harold Ickes, Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of the interior, declared that 
Louisiana's Huey Long was &quot;suffering from halitosis of the intellect.&quot; Then 
there was Secretary of State John Milton Hay's put-down of William Jennings 
Bryan as &quot;a half-baked, glib little briefless jack-leg lawyer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some writers cleverly subvert clichés, giving them a second life. When Diane 
Ackerman says of the rain forest, &quot;the meek inherit nothing,&quot; she plays off the 
established phrase (the meek shall inherit the earth), making her own more 
striking. When Washington Post columnist Mark Shields, a regular metaphor 
machine, refers not to &quot;smoking guns&quot; in trumped-up investigations, but to 
&quot;smoking water pistols,&quot; he creates a fresh metaphor out of a stale one. (If you 
still need convincing of Shields's rhetorical genius, try this metaphor, from 
April 1998: &quot;We don't know if Ken Starr's going to come in with something that 
looks like double parking outside an orphanage on Christmas Eve, or like Lizzie 
Borden in drag.&quot; Or this one: &quot;Everybody in Washington is an ethical eunuch and 
a moral leper who would steal a hot stove and go back for the smoke.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Businesses often tweak clichés into clever names; think of all those hair 
salons: The Mane Attraction, About Faces, A Head of Our Times, and Shear 
Delight.<br>
<br>
In Black English, invective riffs called &quot;doing the dozens&quot; kid others about 
intellectual deficiencies, physical shortcomings, or, especially, &quot;your mamma.&quot; 
The rhythmic, often rhyming ripostes— also called &quot;signifying&quot; or &quot;sounding&quot;— 
demand an ability to ad lib in metaphor:<br>
<br>
Your mamma's so old she used to drive chariots to &nbsp;high school.<br>
<br>
Your mamma's so mean you have to take two trains &nbsp;and a bus to get on her good 
side.<br>
<br>
Your hair is so short it's like blowing dust off a jug.<br>
<br>
Your teeth are so yellow you put the sun out of business.<br>
<br>
You're so ugly you look like you been hit by a ugly stick.<br>
<br>
The comedian Moms Mabley created a comic pile-on of metaphors in a sketch about 
the man her father forced her to marry when she was a teenager, the metaphor in 
each sentence topping the previous one:<br>
<br>
This O-L-D… puny… moanin' man. I mean an O-L-D man. Santa Claus looked like his 
son. He was older than his mother…. The nearest thing to death you've ever seen 
in your life. His shadow weighed more than he did. He got out of breath 
threading a needle. And U-G-L-Y! He was so ugly he hurt my feelings.<br>

<br>
Melody<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
We think of melody as the collection of stirring notes that give a tune 
sweetness. In prose, melody translates into &quot;euphony&quot;— the acoustic effect of 
words combined to be pleasing and harmonious. Sweet words, euphonious phrasing, 
sensuous sentences— they affect us as much as meaning does.<br>
<br>
Our earliest memories of storytelling— listening to nursery rhymes and fairy 
tales intoned in the familiar voices of a parent or grandparent— are sense 
memories. But our love of the sound of words may go further back; it may be our 
legacy from the days when all narrative was set to song.<br>
<br>
The poetic devices available to the sound-conscious prose stylist include 
assonance, consonance, rhyme, alliteration, and onomatopoeia:<br>
<br>
• Assonance repeats vowel sounds within words for effect (clean… neat). 
Consonance lets the initial consonants of words echo with internal consonants 
(Sala-ma-sond). Dr. Seuss used both devices in this bit from Yertle the Turtle 
and Other Stories: &quot;On the far-away Island of Sala-ma-Sond,/Yertle the Turtle 
was king of the pond./ A nice little pond. It was clean. It was neat./ The water 
was warm. There was plenty to eat.&quot;<br>
<br>
• Rhyme sets up an exact correspondence between the final syllable or syllables 
of words. Dr. Seuss loved rhyming names like Yertle the Turtle, and he loved 
rhyming titles— Fox in Socks, The Cat in the Hat, Hop on Pop, and One Fish Two 
Fish Red Fish Blue Fish.<br>
<br>
• Alliteration refers to the repetition of the initial sound— one or more 
letters— of words in a phrase or sentence. Dr. Seuss's Hooray for Diffendorfer 
Day combines alliteration (and rhyme) in the title as well as in the text: &quot;Miss 
Twining teaches tying knots/In neckerchiefs and noodles,/And how to tell 
chrysanthemums / From miniature poodles. / Miss Vining teaches all the ways/A 
pigeon may be peppered,/And how to put a saddle/On a lizard or a leopard.&quot;<br>
<br>
• Onomatopoeia may be Greek to you and me, but those twelve letters just mean 
&quot;name-making.&quot; Pronounced &quot;onna-matta-pee-ah,&quot; the term carries the idea that we 
can name a thing (or action) by imitating the sounds associated with it. With 
onomatopoeia, the sound of the word defines it. In The Lorax, &quot;Grickle grass&quot; is 
the name given by Dr. Seuss to the town's unruly tufts. Seuss characters like 
the Grinch and the Sneetches owe their names to onomatopoeia.<br>
<br>
Zap, zowie, bam, socko, wow, oof, wham, bing, and grrr— comics rely as heavily 
on onomatopoeia as does the kid-book doc. But words used in more serious 
contexts also rely on sound to convey sense. What could be a better word for a 
chattering, flighty, silly person than flibbertigibbet?<br>
<br>
&#65532;Onomato-meaning.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
Dr. Seuss isn't the only children's writer to play to our love of sound. Think 
of the Lewis Carroll characters Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Then there's Rudyard 
Kipling's Rikki-tikki-tavi, whose title is all onomatopoeia, and whose opening 
lines make a medley of exotic sounds:<br>
<br>
This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed, 
through the bathroom of the big bungalow in Segowlee cantonment. Darzee, the 
tailor-bird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the musk-rat, who never comes out into 
the middle of the floor, but always creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, 
but Rikki-tikki-tavi did the real fighting.<br>
<br>
He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but quite 
like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end of his restless 
nose were pink; he could scratch himself anywhere he pleased, with any leg, 
front or back, that he chose to use. He could fluff up his tail till it looked 
like a bottle-brush, and his war cry, as he scuttled through the long grass, was 
&quot;Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!&quot;<br>
<br>
Like onomatopoeia, assonance and consonance are hardly children's play— even 
adults delight in word combos like wishy-washy, mishmash, flimflam, riffraff, 
and chitchat. The novelist Zora Neale Hurston opens Their Eyes Were Watching God 
with a sentence made memorable by assonance:<br>
<br>
Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they come in with 
the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never 
landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked 
to death by Time. That is the life of men.<br>
<br>
Much of Hurston's story, about an African-American woman's struggles to live 
free and fulfilled, is written in the dialect of her native Florida. An entire 
culture, a way of life, a worldview are packed into the simple song of Hurston's 
sentences:<br>
<br>
Course, talkin' don't amount tuh uh hill uh beans when yuh can't do nothin' 
else. And listenin' tuh dat kind uh talk is jus' lak openin' yo' mouth and 
lettin' de moon shine down yo' throat. It's uh known fact, Phoeby, you got tuh 
go there tuh know there. Yo' papa and yo' mama and nobody else can't tell yuh 
and show yuh. Two things everybody's got tuh do fuh theyselves. They got tuh go 
tuh God, and they got tuh find out about living fuh theyselves.<br>
<br>
In the dialect, in the assonance in her heroine's speech, Hurston finds echoes 
in to, a, you, and for. In phrases like yo papa and yo mama she makes English as 
musical as Italian. And got tuh go tuh God uses assonance, consonance, and 
rhythm to make a phrase more musical than its &quot;correct&quot; equivalent, must go to 
God.<br>
<br>

<br>
THE GREAT VERBAL IMPROVISATIONALIST Muhammad Ali sparred with assonance and 
consonance as much as he sparred with other heavyweights: assonance and 
consonance made his &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; catch on as the descriptor for his 
fight with George Foreman in Zaire. Ali even worked rhyme into his riffs, as in 
this one, comparing his condition in that fall of 1974 to his condition in 1964 
when, as an upstart in professional boxing, he fought Sonny Liston for the first 
time:<br>
<br>
I'm experienced now. Professional. Jaw's been broke. Been knocked down a couple 
times. I'm bad! I been chopping trees. I done something new for this fight: I 
done rassled with a alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed 
lightning, throwed thunder in jail. That's bad!<br>
<br>
In the consonance corner, Ali gives us rassled and tussled. As far as rhyme, who 
would have expected whale and jail?<br>
<br>
We think of rhyme as the province of rappers (Ali's descendants), and find it 
infrequently in prose. Alliteration, on the other hand, is a more common device 
in all kinds of writing.<br>
<br>
When Francis X. Clines of the New York Times called Matt Drudge the Internet's 
&quot;Walter Winchell wannabe,&quot; he finds euphony in alliteration. And when Elaine 
Sciolino, also at the Times, profiled Richard Holbrooke after he was nominated 
as chief U.S. representative to the United Nations, sound repetition enlivened 
her lede about a very lively man:<br>
<br>
He is the energizer envoy, a nonstop negotiator who can outflank and outflatter, 
outbluff and outbully all the other players in the room.<br>
<br>
Sciolino's &quot;energizer envoy&quot; is a nice word play as well as nice euphony.<br>
<br>

THE MEMOIRIST HAS A LITTLE more linguistic berth than the journalist, especially 
if the family he is remembering is the Irish clan of Frank McCourt. In Angela's 
Ashes, McCourt captures the colloquial poetry of his father, and indeed of 
Ireland itself. McCourt, Sr., is driven to distraction by the questions of his 
son, raised in New York and abruptly plopped down in the Irish countryside 
(&quot;What are cows, Dad?&quot;— &quot;Cows are cows, son&quot;— and &quot;What are sheep, Dad?&quot;). The 
elder McCourt finally erupts in sonorous harmony with the surrounding landscape:<br>
<br>
Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that 
over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives 
wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?<br>
<br>
And Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke 
sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise 
to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she 
said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the 
twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins 
through the world.<br>
<br>
Dad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins 
started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep 
maaed, the goats ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of 
a motor car cut through everything.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
We can twist poet Alexander Pope's diktat— &quot;the sound must seem an echo of the 
sense&quot;— into a caveat for the novice writer: When sound doesn't echo sense, the 
writing misfires.<br>
<br>
HEAVYHANDEDNESS.<br>
<br>
Techniques like rhyme and alliteration only work when they sound natural. They 
must be used like salt: sparingly. When Spiro Agnew denounced the Eastern 
liberal establishment as &quot;nattering nabobs of negativism,&quot; he may have uttered a 
quotable phrase, but the alliteration seemed forced: No one talks that way, not 
even William Safire, who as White House speechwriter actually coined the phrase.<br>
<br>
Of course, politicos easily fall prey to such follies. Perhaps the worst was 
Warren Harding's &quot;not nostrums but normalcy, not revolution but restoration, not 
agitation but adjustment, not surgery but serenity, not the dramatic but the 
dispassionate, not experiment but equipoise.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jesse Jackson defends his own rhyming phrases, saying that &quot;Down with dope, up 
with hope&quot; gets the point across more powerfully than &quot;Off with narcotics, up 
with sobriety.&quot; He's got a point. But rhyme is best when it's surprising, not 
canned. You almost don't need Jackson around to complete his pat and predictable 
rhymes:<br>
<br>
If my mind can conceive it and my heart can believe it, then I can achieve it.<br>
<br>
I've not decided to run the race for 2000, but I'm going to set the pace for 
2000.<br>

Johnny Cochran's unforgettable phrase about the glove— &quot;If it doesn't fit, you 
must acquit&quot;— may have worked magic on the O.J. jury, but such rhetoric loses 
its fizz over time. Cochran's too-facile rhyme even inspired a Seinfeld parody— 
in the character of Kramer's lawyer, Jackie Chiles.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
In The God of Small Things, the central character, an Indian girl named Rahel, 
negotiates between English and Malayalam, the native language that the adults in 
her family use to camouflage talk they don't want children to hear. The author, 
Arundhati Roy, plays with the sounds of English to comic and sometimes ominous 
effect, as in the moment when bad behavior during an airport meeting with a 
cousin earns Rahel and her twin brother, Estappen, the wrath of their mother, 
Ammu.<br>
<br>
&quot;Estappen!&quot; Ammu said. And an angry feeling rose in her and stopped around her 
heart. A Far More Angry Than Necessary feeling. She felt somehow humiliated by 
this public revolt in her area of jurisdiction. She had wanted a smooth 
performance. A prize for her children in the Indo-British Behavior Competition.<br>
<br>
Chacko said to Ammu in Malayalam, &quot;Please. Later. Not now.&quot;<br>
<br>
And Ammu's angry eyes on Estha said All right. Later.<br>
<br>
And Later became a horrible, menacing, goose-bumpy word.<br>
<br>
Lay. Ter.<br>
<br>
Like a deep-sounding bell in a mossy well. Shivery, and furred. Like moth's 
feet.<br>
<br>
The Play had gone bad. Like pickle in the monsoon.<br>
<br>
Roy repeats &quot;Lay. Ter.&quot;— as well as other sound improvisations (&quot;A Wake A Live A 
Lert&quot;)— as her novel wends its way to a horrible, menacing, goose-bumpy end.<br>

IF SOUNDS GIVE SENSUALITY TO PROSE, few have mastered their charms quite like 
Vladimir Nabokov. He was one novelist who knew how to turn sensuality into 
carnality. What could be more lascivious than these lines, which capture 
perfectly Humbert Humbert's obsession with the twelve-year-old Dolores Haze:<br>
<br>
Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip 
of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on 
the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.<br>
<br>
She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She 
was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. 
But in my arms she was always Lolita.<br>

Rhythm<br>
<br>
Bones<br>
<br>
We all know what rhythm means to poetry: it's those dear little dactyls, it's 
sure-footed Shakespeare, it's Wordsworth, &quot;wándering lónely ás a clóud.&quot; But 
what does rhythm mean to prose? Do we just trade the &quot;da-dah da-dah da-dah 
da-dah da-dah&quot; of iambic pentameter for the banal &quot;yaddah yaddah yaddah&quot; of 
Seinfeld?<br>
<br>
Whatever the genre, rhythm remains, essentially, beat— whether the 4/4 time of 
rhapsodies or the urgent tempos of rap. Rhythm is repetition, incantation, 
timing— perhaps comedic, perhaps dramatic. Rhythm is that deep-down sense of 
music that is as inborn as a heartbeat.<br>
<br>
In most poetry, rhythm is reliable and identifiable. It's meter: the arrangement 
of sounds into set patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables, into longs and 
shorts. The basic metrical units are called &quot;feet&quot; and consist of at least two 
syllables; the most familiar feet are the iamb (&#65532;), the trochee(&#65532;), the anapest 
(&#65532;), and the dactyl (&#65532;).<br>
<br>
As a prose stylist, you don't really need to memorize the names of metric feet, 
but you do need to appreciate their effect. Many believe that iambic pentameter— 
the five-foot lines of, say, Shakespearean sonnets— reflects the natural rhythm 
of English. &quot;It fits without stress, makes a full phrase, and leaves little 
breath at the end,&quot; writes the poet Mary Oliver. &quot;It is, one might say, the 
norm.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#65532;Put your best foot forward.<br>
<br>
But if meter is regular and recognizable in poetry, it's unpredictable in prose, 
varying from line to line with the flow of the words and the undercurrents of 
meaning. In prose— conversation, oration, and narration— rhythm is a matter of 
more subtle patterns, of longs and shorts, ins and outs, ups and downs.<br>
<br>
Flesh<br>
<br>
When we listen carefully to our writing and reshape its rhythms to our liking, 
prose can become music. &quot;If we were more studious to write prose that could be 
read aloud with pleasure to the ear,&quot; wrote Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch in 1916, 
&quot;we should be opening the pores to the ancient sap.&quot;<br>
<br>
Speaking of the ancient sap, many of the most memorable phrases of the Bible, 
and especially the King James Bible of 1611, are so easily received, remembered, 
and recited because of their rhythms.<br>
<br>

Today's jargon-jamming Antipoet— deaf to the musical tradition of meter— might 
wreck such Biblical cadences with words like &quot;Appropriate to Caesar the things 
that appertain to that chief executive.&quot; But don't go thinking metrical schemes 
are obsolete in our post-Biblical times. Check out this passage from 
Make-Believe Town, in which the playwright David Mamet recounts the cleansing 
poker player David &quot;Chip&quot; Brown took in a round of seven-card stud:<br>
<br>
Chip was in a game with a drunk. He held a pair of aces, and the drunk, after 
his fourth card, held four diamonds. Chip was an eleven-to-ten favorite to win 
the hand, but the drunk wouldn't go home. They raised each other thirty-six 
times, and the drunk caught his fifth diamond, and Chip retired broke.<br>
<br>
There it is: the good old iamb (&quot;he héld a páir of áces&quot;; &quot;Chíp retíred bróke&quot;).<br>
<br>
Mamet insists that his characters prefer iambic pentameter and that he indulges 
them, if loosely: &quot;None of us think about it, but we tend to speak that way,&quot; 
Mamet said in an interview on WHYY radio's Fresh Air. &quot;I mean, most of the blues 
is written that way, too: 'I hate to see that evening sun go down.' That's 
iambic pentameter.&quot; Mamet further explained: &quot;Look here, you know, I could sit 
and talk to you all day, but finally at the end, what would we say? That you and 
I had sat and that we spoke, but what we'd spoken of— what would that be? The 
tíme, the pláce, the rádio, the dáy— OK, so you see here I'm on my way to a 
sonnet that's all iambic pentameter.&quot;<br>
<br>

RHYTHM IS NOT SIMPLY a matter of metrics. Winston Churchill's stirring rhetoric 
depended less on meter, per se, than on the rhythms of individual words. In his 
first statement to the House of Commons as prime minister, Churchill declared: 
&quot;I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.&quot; His tough, muscular 
words announce his courage and resolve with the authority of a kettle drum.<br>
<br>
Two decades later, John F. Kennedy charmed the press and the public with a 
speaking style of neat staccato bursts. When asked how he became a hero, Kennedy 
replied iambically, &quot;It was involuntary. They sank my boat.&quot; With the help of 
speechwriters like Theodore Sorenson, Kennedy's sentences stretched out, his 
crisp diction complemented by lyrical cadences. President Kennedy's inaugural 
address in 1961 set up repeating rhythmic patterns that let words and phrases 
play off each other. Rhythms helped his phrases settle easily into our national 
consciousness:<br>
<br>
If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who 
are rich.<br>
<br>
Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.<br>
<br>
And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what 
you can do for your country.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
SPEECHES INTENDED TO MOVE audiences need to be ringing, strong, visceral. And 
they often achieve these effects— as Kennedy proved— through rhythmic 
repetition. But repetition in prose is not always so neat, especially in more 
subtle, less strident passages.<br>
<br>
Ernest Hemingway often used seemingly simple word repetition. Sometimes it 
underscored his theme and verged on incantation (check out the use of nada in &quot;A 
Clean Well-Lighted Place&quot;). At other times, Hemingway built his repetitions into 
a distinctive pulse. Take, for example, the following description in For Whom 
the Bell Tolls. Robert Jordan, the American hero fighting in a guerrilla band 
against the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War, makes love with Maria:<br>
<br>
Then there was the smell of heather crushed and the roughness of the bent stalks 
under her head and the sun bright on her closed eyes… and for her everything was 
red, orange, god-red from the sun on the closed eyes…. For him it was a dark 
passage which led to nowhere, then to nowhere, then again to nowhere, once again 
to nowhere, always and forever to nowhere, heavy on the elbows in the earth to 
nowhere… now beyond all bearing up, up, up and into nowhere, suddenly, 
scaldingly, holdingly all nowhere gone and time absolutely still and they were 
both there, time having stopped and he felt the earth move out and away from 
under them.<br>
<br>
This passage uses layers of repetition to build to its syntactic climax. The 
repeated use of and to link the clauses, as well as the chants of nowhere and 
up, up, up and suddenly, scaldingly, holdingly, and absolutely all culminate in 
the moment when time stops and the earth, metaphorically, moves out and away 
from under them.<br>
<br>
Contemporary novelist Tim O'Brien builds an entire story on a repetition. In The 
Things They Carried, O'Brien reinforces the weight, the routine, the wretched 
burdens of soldiers in Vietnam. By listing the items the way he does, O'Brien 
weighs the reader down with words just as the men were weighed down with 
weapons. The repetition here becomes almost a chant, the eerie chorus of a 
soldier's marching song gone somehow wrong. The repetition is as inescapable as 
their gruesome task:<br>
<br>
The things they carried were largely determined by necessity…. P-38 can openers, 
pocket knives, heat tabs, wristwatches, dog tags, mosquito repellant, chewing 
gum, candy, cigarettes, salt tablets, packets of Kool-Aid, lighters, matches, 
sewing kits, Military Payment Certificates, C rations, and two or three canteens 
of water. Together, these items weighed between 15 and 20 pounds, depending upon 
a man's habits or rate of metabolism. Henry Dobbins, who was a big man, carried 
extra rations; he was especially fond of canned peaches in heavy syrup over 
pound cake. Dave Jensen, who practiced field hygiene, carried a toothbrush, 
dental floss, and several hotel-sized bars of soap he'd stolen on R &amp; R in 
Sydney, Australia. Ted Lavender, who was scared, carried tranquilizers….<br>
<br>
Some things they carried in common…. They shared the weight of memory. They took 
up what others could no longer bear. Often, they carried each other, the wounded 
or the weak. They carried infections. They carried chess sets, basketballs, 
Vietnamese-English dictionaries, insignia of rank, Bronze Stars and Purple 
Hearts, plastic cards imprinted with the Code of Conduct. They carried diseases, 
among them malaria and dysentery. They carried lice and ringworm and leeches and 
paddy algae and various rots and molds. They carried the land itself— a powdery 
orange-red dust that covered their boots and fatigues and faces. They carried 
the sky. The whole atmosphere, they carried it, the humidity, the monsoons, the 
stink of fungus and decay, all of it, they carried gravity.<br>

WRITERS CAN ALSO BUILD RHYTHM through the subtle and wavelike effects on the 
reader of long sentence upon short, of quiet pauses and little breaths— or of 
strong stops and big white spaces.<br>
<br>
Virginia Woolf had an uncanny ability to re-create the pulses and trills of the 
imagination, of characters' delicate inner monologues, and of the blunt 
punctuations of outer dialogues. Woolf blended thoughts and actions in a flow of 
images. Passages like this one, from Mrs. Dalloway, though carefully crafted, 
reflect the mysterious rhythms of the mental stream:<br>
<br>
The hall of the house was cool as a vault. Mrs. Dalloway raised her hand to her 
eyes, and, as the maid shut the door to, and she heard the swish of Lucy's 
skirts, she felt like a nun who has left the world and feels fold round her the 
familiar veils and the response to old devotions. The cook whistled in the 
kitchen. She heard the click of the typewriter. It was her life, and, bending 
her head over the hall table, she bowed beneath the influence, felt blessed and 
purified, saying to herself, as she took the pad with the telephone message on 
it, how moments like this are buds on the tree of life, flowers of darkness they 
are, she thought (as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only); not 
for a moment did she believe in God; but all the more, she thought, taking up 
the pad, must one repay in daily life to servants, yes, to dogs and canaries, 
above all to Richard her husband, who was the foundation of it— of the gay 
sounds, of the green lights, of the cook even whistling, for Mrs. Walker was 
Irish and whistled all day long— one must pay back from this secret deposit of 
exquisite moments, she thought, lifting the pad, while Lucy stood by her, trying 
to explain how<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Dalloway, ma'am—&quot;<br>
<br>
There's no one way to get to &quot;harmonious prose.&quot; If Virginia Woolf mastered the 
music of the elite drawing room, Martin Luther King, Jr., mastered the music of 
street demonstrations. Writing with power and speaking with passion, King 
tailored his style and cadences to his audiences, as on August 23, 1963, when he 
spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. His rhythm and repetition— the 
now, the insistence on being satisfied, the I have a dream— swell in an 
unstoppable tidal wave of feeling. King put it all together: voice, lyricism, 
melody, and rhythm:<br>
<br>
We have… come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of 
now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the 
tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of 
democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of 
segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the 
doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our 
nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of 
brotherhood….<br>
<br>
We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil 
rights, &quot;When will you be satisfied?&quot; We can never be satisfied as long as the 
Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never 
be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot 
gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We 
cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller 
ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in 
Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for 
which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until 
justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream….<br>
<br>
I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and 
frustrations of the moment I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in 
the American dream.<br>
<br>
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true 
meaning of its creed: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are 
created equal.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former 
slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at 
the table of brotherhood.<br>
<br>
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering 
with the heat of injustice, sweltering with oppression, will be transformed into 
an oasis of freedom and justice.<br>
<br>
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where 
they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their 
character.<br>
<br>
I have a dream today.<br>
<br>
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its 
governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and 
nullification, that one day, right there in Alabama, little black boys and black 
girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as 
sisters and brothers.<br>
<br>
I have a dream today.<br>

Cardinal Sins<br>
<br>
MAKING TEXT HUMDRUM.<br>

&#65532;<br>
<br>
It's not just clerics who know how to spoil a beautiful phrase. In What I Saw at 
the Revolution, Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan spoofed staff editors in 
the White House by speculating about how they would eviscerate that most 
rhythmic and powerful of presidential speeches, the Gettysburg Address: 
&quot;Fourscore and seven years ago&quot; would be changed, Noonan jokes, first to 
&quot;eighty-seven years ago,&quot; then to &quot;long ago,&quot; then to &quot;sometime ago&quot;; then it'd 
be deleted altogether. &quot;Our fathers brought forth upon this continent&quot; would end 
up &quot;our fathers and mothers created here.&quot; &quot;Conceived in liberty&quot; would be 
ditched (the margin screams: &quot;too much sexual imagery— sounds like we're talking 
about teen pregnancy&quot;), as would &quot;we cannot dedicate— we cannot consecrate— we 
cannot hallow this ground&quot; (&quot;too negative? Let's talk about what we can do!&quot;).<br>
<br>
&quot;RHYTHM&quot; IS NO DEFENSE FOR<br>
SHODDY JOURNALISM.<br>
<br>
All this encouragement to build rhythm into your prose requires a caveat. It 
takes listening and sensitivity (and some talent) to develop an ear for the 
music of prose. Encouraging &quot;rhythm&quot; is not tantamount to a license for mindless 
repetition or irritating singsong.<br>
<br>
A reporter once refused this editor's request to insert the name of an official 
in a political story because he didn't want to &quot;mess up the rhythm&quot; of his 
sentence. Aside from the sheer idiocy of such an excuse, the sentence he was 
protecting was practically a study in infelicitous meter:<br>
<br>
No law enforcement agency has yet proven it needs all these digital trapdoors. 
&quot;Right now most law enforcement personnel don't have any idea what the NII is&quot;— 
this according to one official who appeared on the panel.<br>
<br>
That rhythm needs to be scrapped, not saved.<br>
<br>
NOT PARALLEL, NOT MUSICAL.<br>
<br>
Parallelism builds rhythm, and nonparallelism kills it. Imagine that Marc Antony 
had said: &quot;I came for the purpose of burying Caesar, not to praise him.&quot; Doesn't 
exactly roll off the tongue.<br>
<br>
Inattentive writers muck up lists badly, throwing imbalanced cadences together 
and leaving their sentences scrambling. The elements of a list should echo each 
other in length, number of syllables, and rhythm. &quot;A government of the people, 
by the people, for the people&quot; works. &quot;A government of the people, that the 
people create, for the people&quot; doesn't.<br>
<br>
If it's impossible to craft a list of exactly parallel elements, at least try to 
let the length of the phrases build, so that you end up with a crescendo, not 
cacophony:<br>
<br>
Have Jell-O brand gelatin. Because it's cool (like ice cream), smooth (like 
pudding), light (like chiffon pie), refreshing (like sherbet), and tastes like 
fruit.<br>
<br>
If you must break your neatly parallel pattern, break it at the end. Let the 
longest or most ungainly phrase tumble out last:<br>
<br>
Disney's The Lion King is part pageant, part puppet show, part parade, with a 
touch of Las Vegas revue thrown in.<br>
<br>
THE REPETITION POLICE.<br>
<br>
Some editors and copy editors bring their eyes to copy, but not their ears. Tone 
deaf and too too literal copy editors will remove repetition whenever they see 
it, ignoring the fact that it is one of our oldest rhetorical tricks. Don't be 
fooled by an editor's fancy terms when you want to keep the repetition in a 
phrase like, oh, &quot;God said let there be light and there was light.&quot; There are 
editors out there who would argue that &quot;the elegant variation&quot; requires changing 
the second &quot;light&quot; to &quot;illumination.&quot;<br>
<br>
Repetition can be a graceful way of changing tack; it can lessen the abruptness 
of a transition. In a story on San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan, 
who had attended an infamous birthday party for political consultant Jack Davis, 
a writer bridged the gap between the end of one section and the beginning of the 
next with this repetition:<br>
<br>
&quot;It was a great party,&quot; Hallinan insisted in an interview months later. &quot;Jack's 
thing [which featured performers in black leather, mutilation, and urination] 
was a little like the Tyson fight. You wouldn't do it yourself and it was pretty 
bizarre, but you're glad you saw it, because it later became the subject of 
conversation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hallinan knows what it means to be the subject of conversation. In the nearly 
two years since he was elected to replace the uncharismatic, almost invisible 
Arlo Smith, he has frequently made news for behavior that, if not quite bizarre, 
is still considered strange by D. A. standards.<br>
<br>
A clueless copy editor nixed the deliberate repetition, changing the sentence to 
&quot;Hallinan knows what it means to be talked about.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tsk tsk.<br>
<br>
Carnal Pleasures<br>
<br>
Singers and songwriters live at language's epicenter— from ancient bards like 
Homer, whose epic narratives were told in song, to the jazzman Cab Calloway, 
whose comic and sometimes profane patter was a foil for the music of his band. 
(Calloway the wordman registered the Harlem vernacular in a book, Mister 
Hepster's Jive Talk Dictionary.)<br>
<br>
Starting in the '60s, Gil Scott-Heron reinvented the notion of jazz patter, his 
Black Power rhetoric backed by a bongo in songs like &quot;Whitey on the Moon,&quot; in 
which the narrator &quot;can't pay no doctor's bills,&quot; even though society's spent 
billions sending a man to the moon:<br>
<br>
A rat done bit my sister Nell<br>
With Whitey on the moon<br>
Her face and arms began to swell<br>
And Whitey's on the moon….<br>
<br>
You know, the man just upped my rent last night<br>
'Cause Whitey's on the moon<br>
No hot water, no toilets, no lights,<br>
But Whitey's on the moon.<br>
<br>
What Scott-Heron is up to is more than just patter. Sure, the blunt language and 
street syntax makes his story seem uncrafted and conversational. But the 
repetition of &quot;Whitey's on the moon&quot; (albeit with slightly different phrasing 
each time) lets him build on his theme with each new utterance. The narrative is 
more proselike than singsongy, but if you count the syllables in each line, 
you'll see that Scott-Heron has his rhythm down cold: every other line is close 
to eight syllables, and the intervening ones are all six.<br>
<br>
Folksingers, too, let narrative unfold in bursts of rhythm. Think of all those 
stories Bob Dylan has told over the years, from &quot;Lonesome Death of Hattie 
Carroll&quot; to &quot;Not Dark Yet.&quot; While some of Dylan's lyrics are pure poetry, some 
are plainly prosaic. The &quot;music&quot; comes from the rhythm of the words, as in his 
classic &quot;Tangled up in Blue&quot;:<br>
<br>
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',<br>
I was layin' in bed,<br>
Wondrin' if she'd changed at all,<br>
If her hair was still red.<br>
<br>
Her folks, they said our lives together<br>
Sure was gonna be rough.<br>
They never did like Mama's homemade dress,<br>
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.<br>
<br>
And I was standing on the side of the road,<br>
Rain fallin' on my shoes.<br>
Heading out for the East Coast,<br>
Lord knows I've paid some dues<br>
Gettin' through.<br>
Tangled up in blue.<br>
<br>
Rap is the latest twist on this tradition of narrative song. Call rap 
&quot;storytelling with a beat,&quot; &quot;sonic bricolage,&quot; or, as one critic prefers, &quot;an 
endless stream of rhythmic verbal jazz.&quot; Into stories of the street, rapping 
griots mix voice, metaphor, rhyme, and beat.<br>
<br>
Hip-hop has gained notoriety for the brutal and misogynistic rhymes of gangsta 
rap (Tupac Shakur's &quot;William Bennett, Delores Tucker, / you's a motherfucker; / 
instead of trying to help a nigger, / you destroy a brother&quot; and Ice Cube's &quot;I'm 
thinking to myself, / 'why did I bang her?' / Now I'm in the closet / looking 
for the hanger&quot;). But rappers like Public Enemy's Chuck D churn out 
authoritative and history-conscious polemics. (Chuck D calls rap &quot;black 
America's CNN.&quot;) Public Enemy's most well-known hit, &quot;Fight the Power,&quot; unfolds 
like a 1989 update of &quot;Whitey on the Moon,&quot; and &quot;Louder than a Bomb&quot; takes on 
subjects like the government's treatment of the black community (&quot;CIA, FBI / All 
they tell is lies / And when I say it they get alarmed / 'Cause I'm louder than 
a bomb&quot;).<br>
<br>
The old-school rap group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five was the first to 
use this musical genre as a gritty medium for serious discourse. Forget correct 
syntax. Forget iambic pentameter. This is rhyme and rhythm used to pack a point. 
This is pure language-as-music. In &quot;The Message,&quot; every syllable is punched out 
like an urgent smack on a drum:<br>
<br>
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge<br>
I'm try-in' not to lose my head<br>
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder<br>
How I keep from going under…<br>
<br>
My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's T.V.<br>
Says she watches too much, is just not healthy<br>
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night<br>
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight<br>
Bill collectors they ring my phone<br>
And scare my wife when I'm not home<br>
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation<br>
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station<br>
Neon King Kong standin' on my back<br>
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac<br>
Midrange, migrained, cancered membrane<br>
Sometimes I think I'm going insane,<br>
I swear I might hijack a plane!<br>
<br>
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge<br>
I'm try-in' not to lose my head<br>
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder<br>
How I keep from going under…<br>
&#65532;&#65532;Epilogue<br>
<br>
From the King James Bible to the lyrics of hip-hop— you might say we've gone 
from &quot;sin and syntax&quot; to &quot;sin and syncopation.&quot; No matter the genre, all 
storytellers are engaged in the same struggle: how to use words, grammar, and 
music to describe the human condition.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember that you are a human being with a soul and the divine right of 
articulate speech,&quot; wrote George Bernard Shaw. &quot;That your native tongue is the 
language of Shakespeare and Milton and the Bible; and don't sit there crooning 
like a bilious pigeon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sin and Syntax has tried to coax, coach, and cajole you out of biliousness. Of 
course, there is much more to making memorable prose than linguistic facility. 
You also need worthy ideas, you need to tell stories with strong plots, and you 
need to cast and control the right characters. When it comes to developing these 
narrative skills, though, no book can help you. Experience is the ultimate 
master.<br>
<br>
Ernest Hemingway once advised prose artists to &quot;Write hard and clear about what 
hurts.&quot; It's good advice. But to follow it, you must stop reading.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;APPENDIX 1&#65532;<br>
<br>
Let's Get Tense<br>
<br>
As anyone who has tried to master French can attest, verb tenses can make even 
the calmest conjugator— well, tense. Derived from the French (and, before that, 
the Latin) word for &quot;time,&quot; tense is the element of a verb that telegraphs 
&quot;when&quot; an action occurred.<br>
<br>
Tense might be signaled through a verb's spelling (sing, sang, sung), through 
its ending (singing), or through the presence of an auxiliary verb (had sung).<br>
<br>
There are three kinds of verb tenses: simple, progressive, and perfect.<br>
<br>
The simple tenses— past, present, future— tell whether something happened in the 
past, happens in the present, or will happen in the future. The present tense in 
some ways is the most open-ended of these simple tenses— when does it begin and 
end? We think of the present tense when we think of something occurring in this 
instant, today, right now— as in &quot;She clamors for more on tenses.&quot; But the 
present tense is also appropriate for something whose state doesn't change, as 
in the sentence &quot;Patience with verb tenses is a virtue,&quot; or when something 
happens habitually, as in &quot;He conjugates with abandon!&quot;<br>
<br>
The progressive and perfect tenses come into play when we are talking about an 
action as it is regarded over time. The progressive tenses convey a sense of 
ongoing or not-yet-completed action. The past progressive kicks in for something 
that was happening in some previous time; the present progressive kicks in for 
something that is happening now; the future progressive kicks in for something 
that will be happening in the future— a coming attraction.<br>
<br>
The perfect tenses refer to actions that are complete, but that occurred in a 
kind of &quot;anterior time&quot;— a time frame preceding the overall sentence or context. 
The past perfect is brought in for an event that transpired before another event 
in simple past: &quot;Melvin had lurked for years before he leaped.&quot; The present 
perfect, which straddles the past and the present, is brought in for actions not 
over and done with: &quot;Melvin has leaped into cyberspace determined to forge a new 
identity.&quot; The future perfect is brought in for an action that will have been 
completed by some future point: &quot;When Melvin returns to meatspace, he will have 
indeed become a STUD4XTC.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you have made it this far without throwing in the towel, pat yourself on the 
back. Then take a deep breath. Tenses get even hinkier, combining into such 
hydra-headed monsters as perfect progressives. The following sentence, for 
example, contains the future perfect progressive tense: &quot;By the time you read 
this, Melvin will have been reveling in ecstasy for five years.&quot;<br>
<br>
Consider yourself lucky for this verbal flexibility. Our pantheon of verb tenses 
didn't always exist. As Charles Barber points out in The English Language, 
Shakespeare could— and did— say &quot;my Ladie Hero hath bin falselie accusde,&quot; but 
he could not say &quot;she is being falsely accused&quot;; the bard's &quot;as if the garment 
had bin made for me&quot; passed muster, but &quot;the garment was being made for me&quot; 
would not have.<br>
<br>
How could we bear to be without the following, none of which would have been 
possible before 1800:<br>
<br>
• We were having a blast with verbs before you got here.<br>
<br>
• Playful punctuation had been developed long before netizens went *nuts* with 
their keyboards.<br>
<br>
• She has been known to disregard logic altogether and lapse into tongues.<br>
<br>
&#65532;A few tips on tense.<br>
<br>
&#65532;So tense it's taut-o-logical.<br>
&#65532;&#65532;APPENDIX 2&#65532;<br>
<br>
Moods and 'tudes<br>
<br>
Verbs are moody little suckers. No doubt you'd already guessed that, but did you 
know that every verb in every sentence expresses what the grammarians call 
&quot;mood&quot; or &quot;mode&quot;— the manner or attitude shading the statement? Mood clues you 
in to the speaker's disposition toward what he or she is saying.<br>
<br>
There are three moods in English: the indicative, the imperative, and the 
subjunctive.<br>
<br>
The indicative is the calmest, most neutral, most matter-of-fact. This is the 
mood of a verb in an ordinary observation:<br>
<br>
&quot;The correcting of prose is endless, because it has no fixed laws; a poem comes 
right with a click, like a box.&quot;<br>
<br>
(William Butler Yeats was stating what he knew.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Languages, while they live, are perpetually changing. God apparently meant them 
for the common people… and the common people will use them freely, as they use 
other gifts of God.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Touché to the Harper's editor who, in 1886, wrote these sentences using the 
indicative mood in the present, past, future, and progressive tenses.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you just love the confidence of the prose sages?&quot;<br>
<br>
(A sentence can pose a question and also be in the indicative.)<br>
<br>
The imperative is the mood of stiff spine and stern expression. It might express 
a command or make a request— and when the direct order is given to others, the 
subject &quot;you&quot; is understood or implied:<br>
<br>
&quot;Be a sport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Say it isn't so.&quot;<br>
<br>
(This direct, blunt form of the imperative conveys a sense of authority.)<br>
<br>
The imperative might also appear via first- and third-person pronouns and the 
auxiliary verb let:<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me tell you about the very rich.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let us go then, you and I, when the evening is spread out against the sky….&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If any man objects, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Call this the kinder, gentler imperative.)<br>
<br>
The subjunctive mood is the whimsical one. It expresses wishes, possibilities, 
and fantasies about conditions or actions that, unfortunately, aren't. Rare in 
everyday speech, the subjunctive has an antique lustre, a linguistic cachet: it 
can lift mere words to eloquence (or, um, grandiosity).<br>
<br>
With most verbs, the subjunctive looks the same as the indicative, with the 
exception of the present tense, when the third-person singular subject requires 
a third-person plural verb: he takes becomes he take, as in &quot;I insist that he 
take St. John's wort.&quot; The subjunctive gets tricky when it involves the verb to 
be. In the present tense, the subjunctive is be, no matter the subject (I be, 
she be, and they be, not I am, she is, or they are). Likewise, the past 
subjunctive is were throughout (&quot;If I were,&quot; not &quot;If I was,&quot; as in &quot;If I were 
depressed, I'd just jet over to Honolulu, wikiwiki.&quot;).<br>
<br>
Here's when it's appropriate to slip into a subjunctive mood:<br>
<br>
In contrary-to-fact statements, or in conditional sentences that start with if, 
include a would, and end up expressing something untrue:<br>
<br>
&quot;If I were you, I'd be sending out that résumé.&quot;<br>
(Implication: I am not you; my job's secure.)<br>
<br>
&quot;If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.&quot;<br>
(Implication: Wishes, unfortunately, don't take you anywhere.)<br>
<br>
As if and as though also commonly introduce contrafactual or hypothetical 
statements and so require the subjunctive:<br>
<br>
&quot;She looked as though she were going to stop her harangue with the arrival of 
the dinner guests. But no.&quot;<br>
(Boor that she is, she dissed me all night long.)<br>
<br>
Do not assume that because a sentence starts with if the subjunctive is 
required. It is only appropriate in statements of contrafactual situations. 
When, in your clause, you're calling up a fact that is or may be true, no 
subjunctive is necessary: &quot;If it rains again, my hair will frizz beyond repair.&quot;<br>
<br>
• In sentences introduced by a set of peculiar verbs (including insist, 
recommend, pray, urge, and ask) that demand— or merely suggest— something:<br>
<br>
&quot;He urged that the ban on French food be modified to allow certain exceptions.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She asked that I be offered anything with chantilly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I insist that he sample the raspberry soufflé.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You demand that she consider the kugelhopf?&quot;<br>
<br>
• In statements expressing a wish for the unattainable:<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish it were not true.&quot;<br>
(Alas, it is.)<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish that she were my lover.&quot;<br>
(Alas, she's my boss.)<br>
<br>
• In phrases designed for poetic or rhetorical effect, and in phrases that have 
become frozen over time:<br>
<br>
&quot;Would that I had wings!&quot;<br>
&quot;The public be damned!&quot;<br>
&quot;Come what may.&quot;<br>
&quot;Go ask the powers that be.&quot;<br>

<br>
Books and Bookmarks<br>
<br>
Books on writing are, as Tom Waits would say, as old as dirt. Aristotle wrote 
the first classics in the genre, Rhetoric and Poetics. Here is an admittedly 
subjective list of favorites from among the many books on language written in 
the past millennium. You've seen many of them referred to in this book; any or 
all of them would give happy company to your dictionary and thesaurus (you do 
have a good dictionary and thesaurus, don't you?).<br>
<br>
The American Language, Fourth Edition. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1936)<br>
<br>
A lifelong project of Baltimore Sun journalist and critic H. L. Mencken, this 
opus comprises a 700-page main volume and two equally long supplements. In it, 
Mencken traces the ways and wiles of English in its American incarnation, 
covering pronunciation, proper names, slang, and dialects— from Czech to 
Chinese. Mencken's passion for the language flashes through, in sentences only 
he could write: &quot;American is full of what Bret Harte called 'the saber-cuts of 
Saxon'; it meets Montaigne's ideal of a succulent and nervous speech, short and 
compact, not as much dedicated and combed out as vehement and brusque, rather 
arbitrary than monotonous, not pedantic but soldierly.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Language Instinct. (New York: Morrow, 1994)<br>
<br>
Steven Pinker, director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at MIT, argues 
that language is a human instinct, like web-spinning in spiders. It's not 
&quot;pedagogical&quot; or &quot;stylistic&quot; grammar, Pinker devotes this book to; it's mental 
grammar: &quot;the brain's program that lets us build an infinite set of sentences 
out of a finite list of words.&quot; Don't miss chapter 12, in which Pinker scraps 
with &quot;The Language Mavens.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Oxford English Dictionary. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)<br>
<br>
Most of us don't have the bookshelf space, let alone the 3,000 bucks, for this 
twenty-volume dictionary-to-end-all-dictionaries. But imagine having 291,500 
entries, not to mention usage examples dating back to Beowolf. The longest entry 
(60,000 words) is devoted to one of the shortest words: the verb set, with its 
more than 430 senses. If you have neither a large bookcase nor a savings account 
dedicated to dictionaries, consider the two-volume tiny-type version, which 
comes with a magnifying glass. Then there's the CD-ROM: you can search by 
keyword, etymological origin, or backwards definition. The OED Online 
&lt;www.oed.com/&gt; showcases new entries as they are completed for the third 
edition, due in 2010. It also features a &quot;word of the day&quot; section for fans 
eager to flex their verbal muscle.<br>
<br>
The Story of English. (New York: Elisabeth Sifton Books/Viking, 1986)<br>
<br>
A collaboration among Robert McCrum, William Cran, and Robert MacNeil (formerly 
of PBS's Newshour), this history travels with the Angles and the Saxons across 
the Continent and over the North Sea, traces the changes in English wrought by 
Norman invaders and the likes of Shakespeare, and trails Mark Twain and his 
American successors. If 350-page history books make you fidgety, go to the 
library and check out videocassettes of the PBS series; you get the same sweep 
of history, but the accents and dialects are more magical in stereo.<br>
<br>
The Complete Plain Words. (New York: State Mutual, 1987)<br>
<br>
Sir Ernest Gowers, the style god entrusted with updating the second edition of 
Fowler's, published the original Plain Words: Their ABC in 1954. Among its many 
entertaining tidbits: George Bernard Shaw going ballistic over split 
infinitives, Winston Churchill going sarcastic on prepositions at the end of 
sentences, and (a personal favorite) an Egyptian minister's message to a civil 
servant, illustrating the value of down-to-earth sentences: &quot;Apollonius to Zeno, 
greeting. You did right to send the chickpeas to Memphis. Farewell.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition. (Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2000)<br>
<br>
This is not a book. It's an icon. Originally copyrighted in 1918, it was known 
as &quot;the little book&quot; among the Cornell University students of Professor William 
Strunk, Jr. One of those students was E. B. White, whose 1957 New Yorker essay 
on Strunk's gem earned him an invitation to update the book and add a thing or 
two himself. Watch for another update soon.<br>
<br>
And— who woulda thunk it?— Strunk's original is on the Web at 
&lt;www.bartleby.com/141/<br>
<br>
On Writing Well. (New York: HarperCollins, 1998)<br>
<br>
William K. Zinsser divides the contents of this eminently wise, eminently 
readable book into &quot;Principles&quot; (The Transition, Clutter, Style, The Audience) 
and &quot;Forms and Methods&quot; (Business Writing, Criticism, Humor). Revising 
repeatedly since 1976, Zinsser boils down his philosophy to four &quot;articles of 
faith&quot;: clarity, simplicity, brevity, and humanity.<br>
<br>
&quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; in A Collection of Essays. (New York: 
Harcourt Brace, 1981)<br>
<br>
A classic written in 1946 by the author of 1984 and Animal Farm, this essay 
appears in several collections of George Orwell's work. It is short but 
substantial, and includes this list of rules:<br>
<br>
i. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to 
seeing in print.<br>
<br>
ii. Never use a long word where a short one will do.<br>
<br>
iii. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.<br>
<br>
iv. Never use the passive where you can use the active.<br>
<br>
v. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can 
think of an everyday English equivalent.<br>
<br>
vi. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything out right barbarous.<br>
<br>
Writing Well, Ninth Edition. (New York: Longman, 1998)<br>
<br>
A whopper: words, sentences, argument, mechanics, exercises— it's all here, it's 
all clear. It does scream &quot;textbook, textbook, textbook,&quot; but the effect is 
mitigated by the insight and erudition of its authors, Donald Hall, a 
distinguished poet, and Sven Birkerts, a book critic and devotee of reading.<br>
<br>
A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language. (Essex: Addison Wesley Longman 
Limited, 1985)<br>
<br>
Randolph Quirk, the dean of British grammarians, led the team that produced this 
behemoth, which will tell you everything— I mean everything— about grammar. 
What's a ditransitive verb? Page 54. Not sure about &quot;formulaic utterance&quot;? Page 
1,463. When to use a dash? Page 1,629. You may be tempted to use big books only 
as doorstops. In this case, you'd be better off finding a brick and picking this 
book up off the floor.<br>
<br>
The Deluxe Transitive Vampire. (New York: Pantheon, 1993)<br>
<br>
This masterpiece of Gothic humor and racy sentences first came out in 1984 and 
was made even more fantastic and fantastical when reprinted in 1993. Call it 
grammar for grownups, or, as author Karen Elizabeth Gordon suggests, &quot;for the 
innocent, the eager, and the doomed.&quot; You will shiver with glee.<br>
<br>
Woe Is I. (New York: Grosset/Putnam, 1996)<br>
<br>
A clear-headed stroll through the labyrinth that is English, this book covers 
all the basics— that and which, subject-verb agreement, the ins and outs of 
plurals. Patricia T. O'Conner manages to amuse, too, in chapters with names like 
&quot;Comma Sutra: The Joy of Punctuation&quot; and &quot;The Compleat Dangler: A Fish out of 
Water.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Careful Writer. (New York: Atheneum, 1977)<br>
<br>
Theodore M. Bernstein first put together this glossary of stylistic snares in 
1965, after a long career as an editor at the New York Times. Bernstein writes 
oh-so-cleanly (and with occasional sly humor) about usage, which he calls the 
&quot;spit and polish&quot; that gives writing precision, accuracy, clarity, and color. If 
you like Bernstein's style, you'll also want a copy of Miss Thistlebottom's 
Hobgoblins, a guide to &quot;the taboos, bugbears, and outmoded rules of English 
usage.&quot; (Miss Thistlebottom is the archetypal, if apocryphal, eighth-grade 
schoolmarm.)<br>
<br>
Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage. (Springfield: Merriam-Webster, 
1993)<br>
<br>
Of the many usage manuals on the market, copy editors tend to prefer this one 
(as they do its cousin in the dictionary department, Merriam-Webster's Tenth 
Collegiate). Authoritative, comprehensive, and easy to read, it follows a 
&quot;descriptive,&quot; rather than a &quot;prescriptive,&quot; philosophy. Which is to say that it 
describes the way words are commonly used rather than preaching right or wrong.<br>
<br>
Modern American Usage. (New York: Hill and Wang, 1998)<br>
<br>
In tribute to its creator, Wilson Follett, an Ivy League prof and noted editor, 
this book was edited and completed in 1966 by Jacques Barzun and a &quot;small group 
of writers and teachers of English&quot; including Carlos Baker and Lionel Trilling. 
Revised and updated in 1998 by Erik Wensberg, it remains a lucid lexicon true to 
Follett's original, which aimed to &quot;clear up certain current notions about usage 
and grammar, purism and poetry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Modern English Usage. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996)<br>
<br>
The idiosyncratic H. W. Fowler first published this, the wordsmith's ur-text, in 
1926. The Great Schoolmaster set about to tame the wild edges of English with 
wit and temerity. Commonly called Fowler's, this bible was revised in 1965 by 
Sir Ernest Gowers and in 1996 by language historian Robert Burchfield. If you 
really want to flesh out your collection, track down a first edition. Burchfield 
is ever-so-informative, but not nearly as much fun as Fowler.<br>
<br>
Out of the Loud Hound of Darkness. (New York: Pantheon, 1998)<br>
<br>
If you're a fan of Gothic grammarian Karen Elizabeth Gordon, you'll want to 
explore this volume. Call it a fictionary, call it a dictionarrative, this book 
will set you straight on the difference between climactic and climatic, flounder 
and founder— that is, if you can keep your attention on usage when characters 
like Natty Ampersand and Capriccio are making mischief. Other Gordon books worth 
your while are The Disheveled Dictionary (words to die for), Torn Wings and Faux 
Pas (word pairs and style pointers), and The Well-Tempered Sentence (everything 
you ever wanted to know about punctuation).<br>
<br>
Wired Style. (New York: Broadway, 1999)<br>
<br>
If you're shaky on the difference between a computer chip and a chocolate chip, 
this book's for you. At the risk of shameless self-promotion, I'll tell you that 
A to Z this glossary clarifies the definitions of Internet, internet, and 
intranet and separates the geek slang from the gobbledygook. An introductory 
essay lays out the Zeitgeist according to Wired magazine, and a Style FAQ 
answers all those frequently asked questions.<br>
<br>
Amo, Amas, Amat and More. (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1985)<br>
<br>
You may want to sprinkle your prose with phrases like sui generis. (That's one 
way to avoid unique.) Or you may want to know the difference between e.g. and 
i.e. Or you may just want to pronounce your Latin phrases correctly when you 
brandish them at the office. Whatever your motives, Eugene Ehrlich, editor at 
the Oxford American Dictionary, gives you these and 1,400 other Latin pearls, in 
flagrante delicto. For the same versatility in French, try Je Ne Sais What? by 
Jon Winokur.<br>
<br>
History of English Prose Rhythm. (London: Macmillan, 1922)<br>
<br>
One of the most influential literary critics of the late Victorian era, George 
Saintsbury believed in the separability of form and subject matter. He was known 
for his unsurpassed ear for the felicities of sound and meter, which he applies 
to various texts in this book, originally published in 1912. Let Saintsbury 
guide you through the literature of iambs and anapests.<br>
<br>
The King James Bible.<br>
<br>
Feel free to pick among the many, many contemporary versions of this translation 
of the Holy Bible, which hit the streets in 1611. Its poetry works whether or 
not you're a believer, and it resonates profoundly through our literary culture. 
If you like this stuff, you may also want to check out The Book of Common 
Prayer. For musicality, few texts beat the Prayer of Consecration and the Prayer 
of Humble Access in the Eucharist, or some of the Collects (try the First Sunday 
in Advent, Palm Sunday, and Trinity Sunday). Look in antiquarian bookstores for 
a version that predates the unmusical revision of 1979.<br>
<br>
Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres. (Carbondale, Illinois: Southern 
Illinois University Press, 1965)<br>
<br>
This facsimile reproduction of fourscore-plus lectures by Dr. Hugh Blair was 
originally published in 1783 and revised 130 times before 1911. Blair was a 
well-known university lecturer, a preacher to a fashionable Edinburgh 
congregation, an editor, and a literary tastemaker. He wrote for his age the 
kind of book Quintilian produced for the first century A.D., and he refers 
repeatedly to that Roman as well as to Aristotle, Longinus, and Cicero.<br>
<br>
Letters to a Young Poet. (New York: Vintage Books, 1984)<br>
<br>
Originally published in 1934, this is a collection of ten letters written by the 
great German poet Rainer Maria Rilke to a young correspondent. Read it when 
you're ready to give up as a writer. Rilke will re-inspire you.<br>
<br>
On the Art of Writing. (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1916)<br>
<br>
Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch delivered these lectures in 1913 and 1914, and if 
you've always wondered what it would be like to go to Cambridge, these erudite 
essays will give you a taste. (They are also available in an edition published 
by Folcroft Library Editions in 1978.) Quiller-Couch's essays on jargon are 
especially edifying. His translation of Hamlet's most famous soliloquy into 
bureaucratese set the stage for Orwell to revise Ecclesiastes. Here's how Sir 
Arthur purposely butchered &quot;To be or not to be&quot;:<br>
<br>
To be, or the contrary? Whether the former or the latter be preferable would 
seem to admit of some difference of opinion; the answer in the present case 
being of an affirmative or of a negative character according as to whether one 
elects on the one hand to mentally suffer the disfavour of fortune, albeit in an 
extreme degree, or on the other to boldly envisage adverse conditions in the 
prospect of eventually bringing them to a conclusion. The condition of sleep is 
similar to, if not indistinguishable from that of death; and with the addition 
of finality the former might be considered identical with the latter: so that in 
this connection it might be argued with regard to sleep that, could the addition 
be effected, a termination would be put to the endurance of a multiplicity of 
inconveniences, not to mention a number of downright evils incidental to our 
fallen humanity, and thus a consummation achieved of a most gratifying nature.&quot;<br>
<br>
Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia. (New York: HarperCollins, 1996)<br>
<br>
William Rose Benét based his 1948 encyclopedia (now in its fourth edition) on a 
similar nineteenth-century reference book by Ebenezer Cobham Brewer. It lists 
authors, critics, and major literary works; think of it as Leonard Maltin meets 
the Norton Anthology. What's Madame Bovary's first name? Who was the real George 
Sand? What did Macduff do in Macbeth? All the answers are here.<br>
<br>
Rhetoric Made Racy. (Chicago: George Sherwood &amp; Company, 1884)<br>
<br>
Doesn't any bookshelf housing a book called Sin and Syntax also deserve Rhetoric 
Made Racy?<br>
<br>
Write It Right. (New York: Walter Neale, 1909)<br>
<br>
&quot;The author's main purpose in this book is to teach precision in writing,&quot; 
begins Ambrose Bierce, &quot;and of good writing (which, essentially, is clear 
thinking made visible) precision is the point of capital concern.&quot; This style 
and usage handbook (Bierce calls it his &quot;Little Blacklist of Literary Faults&quot;) 
will give you distinctions still worth knowing, like the difference between 
literally and figuratively (&quot;It is bad enough to exaggerate, but to affirm the 
truth of the exaggeration is intolerable&quot;). You'll also see &quot;needless&quot; words 
gored (if get married is correct, why don't we say got dead?) Some of the 
entries are charmingly outdated (Bierce considers the abbreviation of pantaloons 
&quot;vulgar exceedingly&quot; and urges you never to swap &quot;pants&quot; for trousers), but this 
book— not to mention Bierce's more well-known Devil's Dictionary— is worth the 
bucks if you see it lying around in some antiquarian bookstore.<br>

<br>
Constance Hale spent her childhood in Hawaii, messing around in the kapakahi 
syntax of Pidgin English. She went on to study English literature at Princeton 
University and to earn a master's degree in journalism at the University of 
California, Berkeley. After newspapering for a few years, she landed at Wired, 
where she dabbled in old and new media and wrote Wired Style: Principles of 
English Usage in the Digital Age. She continues to work in print and online, and 
teaches writing and grammar to grown-ups. Hale lives in Oakland, California, 
with a guy named Bruce and a dog named Homer (after the Greek poet, not Bart 
Simpson's father!).<br>

&#65532;Notes<br>
<br>
&#65532;Every noun is either a person, place, concrete thing, or intangible thing. A 
noun might fall into other categories as well:<br>
<br>
A common noun refers generically to people, places, or things and so is written 
with all lowercase letters (actor, state, movie).<br>
<br>
A proper noun is much more specific, referring to one and only one person, 
place, or thing (Frances McDormand, North Dakota, Fargo) and written with an 
initial capital letter— in the case of some brands, with internal caps as well 
(PolyGram Filmed Entertainment).<br>
<br>
In compound nouns, nouns double up to express a whole that is more than the sum 
of its parts (film star, silver screen, award winner).<br>
<br>
&#65532;Over the centuries, grammar guides and style manuals have favored Anglo-Saxon 
pedigree. Some style stentorians still cling to the patently ridiculous— not to 
mention jingoistic— proclamation &quot;Prefer the Saxon to the Roman.&quot; This meme 
started in England in the sixteenth century, when &quot;inkhorn terms&quot; (Latinisms and 
foreign phrases creeping into the Anglo-Saxon lexicon) were disparaged as a 
vestige of the Norman invasion. (In 1560, Thomas Wilson, in The Arte of 
Rhetorique, denounced the &quot;long Ciceronian sentences&quot; and &quot;subordinate clauses&quot; 
larding the language.)<br>
<br>
But this is silly. Why should a &quot;foreword&quot; be preferable to a &quot;preface&quot;? Why is 
&quot;swear&quot; necessarily better than &quot;blaspheme&quot;? In Grammar and Good Taste, Dennis 
E. Baron shows the laughable lengths to which philologists would take this 
argument: William Barnes, in the nineteenth century, suggested that we replace 
the Latinate criticism with the Saxon deemster-hood, grammar with speechcraft, 
botany with wortlore, and active with sprack.<br>
<br>
Ack!<br>
<br>
&#65532;Poke fun at euphemisms whenever you can, as did H. L. Mencken when he was 
implored to create a euphemism for strip-teasing. It all started when Mencken, 
the author of The American Language, received this letter from a Miss Georgia 
Sothern:<br>
<br>
It happens that I am a practitioner of the fine art of strip-teasing. 
Strip-teasing is a formal and rhythmic disrobing of the body in public. In 
recent years there has been a great deal of uninformed criticism levelled 
against my profession.<br>
<br>
Most of it is without foundation and arises because of the unfortunate word 
strip-teasing, which creates the wrong connotations in the mind of the public.<br>
<br>
I feel sure that if you could coin a new and more palatable word to describe 
this art, the objections to it would vanish and I and my colleagues would have 
easier going. I hope that the science of semantics can find time to help the 
verbally underprivileged members of my profession. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mencken replied, tongue firmly in— oh, never mind where his tongue was:<br>
<br>
I need not tell you that I sympathize with you in your affliction, and wish that 
I could help you. Unfortunately, no really persuasive new name suggests itself. 
It might be a good idea to relate strip-teasing in some way or other to the 
associated zoölogical phenomenon of molting. Thus the word moltician comes to 
mind, but it must be rejected because of its likeness to mortician.<br>
<br>
A resort to the scientific name for molting, which is ecdysis, produces both 
ecdysist and ecdysiast. Then there are suggestions in the names of some of the 
creatures which practice molting. The scientific name for the common crab is 
Callinectes hastastus, which produces callinectian. Again, there is a family of 
lizards called the Geckonidae, and their name produces gecko. Perhaps your 
advisers may be able to find other suggestion in the same general direction.<br>
<br>
Georgia Sothern cast her fate with ecdysiast. And thus— Mencken's facetiousness 
notwithstanding— was a euphemism born.<br>
<br>
&#65532;We hate euphemisms, but you gotta hand it to the Mr. and Miss Lonelyhearts in 
the personals, who in their refusal to be doomed by external reality have 
created euphemisms for fat that are made palatable by a sense of humor:<br>
<br>
&quot;very attractive Rubenesque beauty&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;the bigger the better&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;large and lovely&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;big beautiful blonde&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;chubby teddy bear&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;volumes to offer&quot;<br>
<br>
&#65532;When Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan discovered that George Bush was 
constitutionally unable to use the pronoun I and killed sentences or ideas 
expressed via the first person, she finessed the problem by adopting a 
construction more palatable to the Prez, &quot;I am one who&quot;:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am one who is not a card-carrying member of the ACLU.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am one who feels it is wrong to release from prison murderers who have not 
served enough time to be eligible for parole.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am one who believes it is right for teachers to say the 'Pledge of 
Allegiance' to the flag of our country….&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The speculation among his friends and staff,&quot; Noonan writes in What I Saw at 
the Revolution, &quot;was that it was due to his doughty old mom, who used to rap his 
knuckles for bragging, a brag apparently being defined as any sentence with the 
first-person singular as its subject.&quot; Noonan soon became adept at crafting 
pronounless sentences: I moved to Texas and soon we joined the Republican party 
became Moved to Texas, joined the Republican party, raised a family. On Bush, 
those sentences sounded natural and relaxed, though the spectre of a president 
on the Capitol steps raising his hand and saying Do solemnly swear, will 
preserve and protect gave Noonan pause.<br>
<br>
&#65532;If you like that piece of English As She Is Taught, you'll love some of the 
others in what Mark Twain dubbed a &quot;darling literary curiosity.&quot; (Twain helped 
publicize the book and wrote its introductory essay.) Take these:<br>
<br>
Every sentence and name of God should begin with a caterpillar.<br>
<br>
Capital letters begin at breviation.<br>
<br>
A quotation is asking a question.<br>
<br>
An Exclamation Point is what causes surprise.<br>
<br>
Brackets set things off so they wont have anything to do with the sentence.<br>
<br>
Grammar is how to talk good.<br>
<br>
Grammar gives us the languish.<br>
<br>
We study Grammar to get the senses.<br>
<br>
A common noun is small things.<br>
<br>
A proper noun is peoples names.<br>
<br>
A pronoun is a word when we cant get a noun.<br>
<br>
A pronoun is a word which is just as good as a noun.<br>
<br>
The two kinds of Pronouns is I and O.<br>
<br>
The plural is formed by turning book into books.<br>
<br>
Person in Grammar tells us whether he is a man or a woman. It is always an 
animal or something that isnt alive.<br>
<br>
A verb is something to eat.<br>
<br>
An intransitiv verb expresses an act not done to another as James did not strike 
John.<br>
<br>
The Moods in English Gram. are the Indicative, Potential, Subjugated, and 
Infinitif.<br>
<br>
The optative mood is a mood in a verb when any body knows you have done any 
thing.<br>
<br>
The sign if shows the potative mood.<br>
<br>
A dependent sentence is one that hangs from its clause.<br>
<br>
All sentences are either simple or confound.<br>
<br>
A word governed by another is called its regiment.<br>
<br>
Rhythm is a horse trotting on a road.<br>
<br>
Rhyme makes two words sound just alike.<br>
<br>
A figure means something different from what it says.<br>
<br>
Can in poetry is sometimes used for cant.<br>
<br>
Prose tells things that are true right along just as they are and poetry makes 
it up as you go along.<br>
<br>
A preposition is a word that shews the position of one thing with kind regards 
to another.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Prepositions often convey spatial relationships, telling us where X is in 
relation to Y. So inventive schoolteachers came up with a useful mnemonic for 
students struggling with prepositions. To test whether a word is a preposition, 
try putting it in front of the words &quot;the log.&quot; If the phrase makes sense, 
you've got a preposition:<br>
<br>
before the log (Yes)<br>
<br>
outside the log (Yes)<br>
<br>
to the log (Yes)<br>
<br>
under the log (Yes)<br>
<br>
within the log (Yes)<br>
<br>
frog the log (No)<br>
<br>
bog the log (No)<br>
<br>
clog the log (No)<br>
<br>
&#65532;Cobweblike<br>
<br>
The folksinger Loudon Wainwright III vents his spleen about the misuse of like 
in a song called &quot;Cobwebs&quot; on his 1995 recording, Grown Man. &quot;I prefer ah or 
er.&quot; Wainwright sings, dissing like as &quot;just an ugly little four-letter word.&quot; 
Mark his avoidance of the little sucker:<br>
<br>
Well it stumbles and it falls off of almost every tongue<br>
<br>
Give a listen and you will hear<br>
<br>
It's lurkin' like a land mine<br>
<br>
In almost every sentence<br>
<br>
It's an assault to my mind's ear<br>
<br>
Used to be a preposition<br>
<br>
Then it was a conjunction<br>
<br>
Now it's used as an audible pause.<br>
<br>
Oh I hate it when I hear it….<br>
<br>
There oughta be some laws.<br>
<br>
Wainwright wonders aloud whether using like instead of as if started &quot;back with 
Jack Kerouac.&quot; But whenever it started, he notes, &quot;the meaning's covered in 
cobwebs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#65532;Readme.<br>
<br>
The imperative mood can be used to convey immediacy, by co-opting the reader, or 
it can be used as a command, to convey authority: Be there or be square, for 
example, or Readme. First-person pronouns can also make implied subjects: Been 
there. Done that. (I is the subject.) Let's go! (We is the subject.)<br>
<br>
For more, go to Appendix 2, which dwells on the imperative and other moods.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Get these or get thee to a mummery.<br>
<br>
Here's a simplified, slimmed-down list of tricky subject-verb agreements:<br>
<br>
When two nouns are joined by and, that compound subject is plural and needs a 
plural verb: &quot;The green eggs and the yellow eggs are in the Easter basket; the 
blue egg is still hidden in the yard.&quot;<br>
<br>
When two nouns are joined by and but act as one entity, the verb must agree with 
the single subject: &quot;Green eggs and ham is not my favorite breakfast (much as I 
love Dr. Seuss).&quot;<br>
<br>
When two nouns are linked by prepositions like with, in addition to, and as well 
as, beware— the verb must agree with the first noun, the true subject: &quot;Green 
Eggs and Ham, together with The Cat in the Hat, keeps the kids from horsing 
around.&quot;<br>
<br>
When an indefinite pronoun is the subject, take special care. Pronouns like 
anybody, each, everyone, much, and nobody take singular verbs: &quot;Everyone 
remembers that cold, cold wet day.&quot; But other indefinite pronouns, like both, 
few, most, and some, take plural verbs: &quot;Few, though, ever face Thing One and 
Thing Two.&quot;<br>
<br>
Collective nouns (government, corporation, band, group) are singular, and so 
take the singular verb: &quot;The company decides whether or not its chef can serve 
green eggs and ham.&quot;<br>
<br>
Certain plural quantities act as singular entities when they are the subject of 
a sentence: &quot;Twelve months is a long time to wait for a change of menu.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some nouns that might seem plural— partly because they end in s, like the United 
States or mathematics— are actually singular: &quot;Mathematics always makes me want 
to seek refuge in green eggs and ham.&quot;<br>
<br>
Certain words (alumnus/alumni, criterion/criteria, datum/ data, medium/media, 
memorandum/memoranda) live in a weird limbo between Latin and English. Latin 
telegraphs a word's number via its ending: -us, -ion, and -um are singularis. So 
if you want to sound hypercorrect, observe the Latin: &quot;This new medium, this 
World Wide Web, is no place for Dr. Seuss.&quot; If you want to sound hyperhip, 
forget the Latin: &quot;This data on green eggs and ham is taxing my hard drive.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#65532;Objects of our attention.<br>
<br>
One way to think of the direct object is as the answer to the question Whom? or 
What? With The meek inherit nothing, when you ask the question &quot;The meek inherit 
what?&quot; The answer, the direct object, is &quot;nothing.&quot; With Slime-coated vines may 
send golden lion tamarins skidding, the question becomes &quot;The slime-coated vines 
may send whom skidding?&quot; The answer, the direct object, is &quot;golden lion 
tamarins.&quot; (For our purposes, who and whom extend to the animal kingdom.)<br>
<br>
The indirect object answers the question To (or For) whom is the action 
committed? or To (For) what? In The scientists give the monkeys bananas and 
crickets, when you ask the question &quot;To whom do the scientists give bananas and 
crickets?&quot; the answer, the indirect object, is &quot;the monkeys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#65532;Complements, with my compliments.<br>
<br>
This complement stuff gets complicated. In addition to the subjective 
complement— which is what the predicate nouns and predicate adjectives following 
a linking verb really are— there is a part of the sentence known as an 
&quot;objective complement.&quot; This is a noun or adjective that follows a complex 
transitive verb and a direct object and modifies the direct object. Here are 
some sample objective complements from The Deluxe Transitive Vampire to clue you 
in:<br>
<br>
NOUNS:<br>
<br>
The robot designated the dentist his partner.<br>
<br>
Sir Gallimauf appointed Carmilla ambassador.<br>
<br>
ADJECTIVES:<br>
<br>
Those furtive tidings made Gwendolyn gruff.<br>
<br>
All this friction makes Alyosha's hands rough.<br>
<br>
These teethmarks render our marriage null and void.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Participling the waters….<br>
<br>
Participles are limber little suckers. Most often, when they're not part of the 
verb phrase itself, they're acting as adjectives. They can modify single words 
(&quot;the finger-picking guitarist&quot;) or they can be parts of adjectival phrases 
(&quot;Finger-picking his way through 'Honeysuckle Rose,' Led Kaapana thrilled the 
crowd&quot;). But sometimes participles contort themselves into prepositions 
(according to, concerning, regarding, speaking of) and even conjunctions 
(supposing, provided that, granted that).<br>
<br>
&#65532;The wedding cake or the icing?<br>
<br>
If you're a real grammar masochist— in other words, your eyes have not glazed 
over, and you are twitching for more— this box is for you.<br>
<br>
Some grammarians wax on about &quot;restrictive&quot; and &quot;nonrestrictive&quot; clauses, or 
&quot;essential&quot; and &quot;nonessential&quot; clauses, or &quot;defining&quot; and &quot;nondefining&quot; clauses. 
No matter the nomenclature, all these names attempt to explain when to use that 
and when to use which. Just to reiterate: The information in a that clause is 
restrictive/essential/defining— it is necessary to bake the cake that is the 
sentence. The information in a which clause is 
nonrestrictive/nonessential/nondefining— it just ices the cake.<br>
<br>
If that seems straight to you, here's a little more refinement. Every now and 
then which is used when that is called for grammatically. Clarity trumps 
grammar. In the proverb &quot;All that glitters is not gold,&quot; that introduces the 
restrictive clause. But we swap that with which when the clause appears in a 
sentence like &quot;He said that that which glitters is not gold.&quot; Three thats in a 
row would only confuse.<br>
<br>
A couple other random points: in restrictive/ essential/defining clauses, the 
relative pronoun that can stand in for people or things; the relative pronoun 
who can also stand in for people and, for those of the Garbo persuasion, pets.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Balancing acts.<br>
<br>
Punctuation gets dicey once you leave the world of simple sentences. Keep in 
mind that whole thoughts— entire clauses— need to be marked off by either 
punctuation or a conjunction. Here are the five basic ways to punctuate two 
complete thoughts, with independent clauses indicated by underlining:<br>
<br>
Let the two clauses stand on their own, separated by a period (and thank you, 
Leo Tolstoy):<br>
<br>
All happy families resemble each other. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its 
own way.<br>
<br>
Link the two clauses ever so slightly, by using a semicolon instead of a period:<br>
<br>
All happy families resemble each other; each unhappy family is unhappy in its 
own way.<br>
<br>
Strengthen the linkage by using a coordinate conjunction and a comma between the 
two clauses:<br>
<br>
All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in 
its own way.<br>
<br>
Subordinate one clause to the other, by starting it with a subordinate 
conjunction:<br>
<br>
Although all happy families resemble each other, each unhappy family is unhappy 
in its own way.<br>
<br>
Emphasize the paradox by separating the two clauses with a conjunctive adverb:<br>
<br>
All happy families resemble each other; however, each unhappy family is unhappy 
in its own way.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Ode to a tape recorder.<br>
<br>
Transcribing talk is not tantamount to writing, but it offers one technique to 
cultivate voice. Some writers do start by speaking their ideas into tape 
recorders, to let their voices flow, to then be able to hear themselves. Others 
read their lines aloud, over and over, recasting any word or sentence that does 
not roll off the tongue. Anything that makes you cringe when you read it aloud 
needs rewriting.<br>
<br>
&#65532;More on metaphor.<br>
<br>
Imagery relies upon the re-creation in words of a concrete visual image. An 
image means only what it literally is: a marigold, an Appaloosa, a black 
Underwood typewriter.<br>
<br>
Metaphor and simile involve comparisons between unlike things. In simile the 
comparison is expressed through words such as like, as, than, similar to, and 
resembles (&quot;louder than a bomb&quot;). In metaphor the comparison is expressed when a 
figurative term is substituted for a literal term. When a man's buddies refer to 
his Marla Maples­ lookalike spouse as a &quot;trophy wife&quot; they're not just jealous, 
they are masters of metaphor. When a too-busy trial lawyer tells her hubby she 
doesn't &quot;have the bandwidth&quot; to plan dinner, her metaphor says: &quot;I am not a 
trophy wife.&quot;<br>
<br>
Symbol refers to the use of one thing to mean much more than what it is. A light 
bulb is a trite symbol for an idea. &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot; is a poetic symbol for 
the consequences of choice.<br>
<br>
Analogy is a whole web of metaphors in which a likeness is drawn though parallel 
structure, like explaining a complicated war in terms of a simple football game.<br>
<br>
&#65532;Onomato-meaning.<br>
<br>
Some sounds have acquired a kind of meaning of their own. Consider these:<br>
<br>
A short i often suggests smallness, as little, slim, kid, chit, thin, skinny, 
imp, shrimp, piddling.<br>
<br>
An fl- at the start of a word can convey awkward or jerky movement, as in 
flounder, flitter, flail, flutter, flipflop, flurry, fling.<br>
<br>
The hard consonants b, d, c, k, q, p, and t— especially when followed by -ash— 
represent explosive action, as in bash, blast, crash, dash, gash, gnash, trash, 
or suggest sudden noise: pop, tap, quack, crackle.<br>
<br>
A closing -sh often suggests soft, rustling sounds or the flow of water: swish, 
hush, flush, gush, rush, slush.<br>
<br>
The nasal sn- sound begins many words concerning the nose— or facial 
contortions: sneeze, snort, sniff, sniffle, snuff, snarl, snivel, snout, sneer, 
snicker.<br>
<br>
Finally, -in, -ing, and -ong are used to convey a bell-like chime, as in ring, 
ding, ding-dong, bong, gong, ping, and Edgar Allan Poe's tintinnabulation (&quot;The 
tintinnabu-lation that so musically wells / From the bells, bells, bells, 
bells….&quot;).<br>
<br>
&#65532;Put your best foot forward.<br>
<br>
Metric feet can have up to five syllables (as does the dochmiac), but the most 
common have two or three:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
Here's a little ditty, cited in Richard Lederer's The Miracle of Language, to 
help you get a handle on meter. Read it out loud:<br>
<br>
The íambs gó from shórt to lóng.<br>
<br>
Tróchees síng a márching sóng.<br>
<br>
Dáctyls go dáncing as líght as a féather.<br>
<br>
But the ánapest's dífferent, you sée, altogéther.<br>
<br>
&#65532;A few tips on tense.<br>
<br>
Stick to the simple present tense when possible, for it often guarantees strong, 
direct writing. If the past is required, the simple past is equally compelling. 
Part of the reason that sentences by, say, Dr. Seuss are so indelible is that 
they rely on rhythmically bold simple tenses (&quot;The sun did not shine / It was 
too wet to play / So we sat in the house / All that cold, cold wet day&quot;).<br>
<br>
Keep your tenses logical and consistent. Within a larger narrative, verbs must 
live in the same time zone. Don't arbitrarily bob and weave from past to present 
to future.<br>
<br>
Within sentences, several things may each be in different time zones. Don't get 
flummoxed. Logic it out. Graph it if you have to.<br>
<br>
&#65532;So tense it's taut-o-logical.<br>
<br>
Here's the standard way to conjugate to do in the major tenses:<br>
<br>
&#65532;<br>
<br>
Nonstandard forms of English play fast and loose with tense, but their grammars 
often have their own loopy logic. In the 1880s, the Warrensburg Journal reported 
these vernacular conjugations of to do it (which were in turn recorded for 
posterity in Rhetoric Made Racy):<br>
